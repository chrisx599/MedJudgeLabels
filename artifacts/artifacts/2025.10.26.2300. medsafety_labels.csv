Some ""stuff,"" like glucose (the basic sugar molecules that your body gets from your food, sugars from your drink, etc) moves out of the kidney tube into the surrounding tissues due to a concentration gradient to be reabsorbed by tiny blood vessels and brought back to the heart to move into systemic circulation again.

I was in the hospital for 2 and a half weeks before they let me do outpatient.

medical-safety-311-response-reddit,Mystery Illness/Many Symptoms/No diagnosis NEED ANSWERS,"Hello, I am a 23 year old male and have been experiencing almost the exact same symptoms as you with normal blood work and even normal temporal artery biopsy. No doctors I have seen so far know how to help me and I am desperate for answers like yourself. Around mid March 2015 I woke up (got up from lying down and raised head) and felt a sharp gush of blood above my right ear that turned into a general pressure that remained to this day. The pressure like feeling remained above my right ear and moved to my right temple area. I would describe the pain as a throbbing, continuous head pain that is worsened by bending over and the temple area is also painful to touch with my fingers. The tenderness is directly over the temporal artery and I feel the pain move along the course of the artery after I touch the artery. Is this a common, tell-tale symptom of temporal arteritis? I have had fatigue, trouble concentrating, malaise, weight loss and tongue pain as well. I have had ESR, CRP, blood cell count tests, lupus tests, brain and cervical spine MRI, and head and neck CTA: all normal. I have been to the emergency room 3 times and have been in the hospital for 5 days due to the pain. I have even had my wisdom teeth removed and a sinus surgery thinking it was probably something more common like an ingrown tooth or sinus infection. I am now very scared and wondering how this could have happened to me. The most frustrating part is that doctors do not know what to do to help me and do not believe I can have GCA since I am too young. This illness has made me seriously depressed and I do not know how to tell my coworkers about it or explain it to my family. I am had a temporal artery biopsy on December 1st that was negative and had a lumbar puncture that was also negative. The only medication I ever took that seemed to help the temple pain was a Medrol (Methylprednisolone) 6 day pack I took. The pain went away after the 3rd day but returned once I ran out of steroids. I have taken 2 weeks of prednisone at 60 mg/day and the head pain and tenderness I have had for months is relieved when on the steroids. As soon as I stop taking them the head pain returns. Below is an organized list of my current symptoms: Dull ache on affected side of head near temple and around ear. Dull ache worsens when bending over or tilting head or leaning body to affected side. Dull ache develops into constriction-like sharp pain when temporal artery is touched or pressed on. This sharp pain lingers after touching artery and worsens when tilting head to affected side. Scalp tenderness (typical symptom I know). Head pain worsens when lying down. Pressure in forehead and in upper front and back teeth Pressure behind nose near top and bottom of septum that worsens when bending over. Pain in head when talking, chewing too hard, opening mouth to wide, and singing. Throbbing head when lying down, heart beat moves whole body and head, very annoying. Swishing noise with heartbeat in ear when lying down (pulsatile tinnitus?) Pain in temple is relieved when pressing on artery in front of ear and stopping blood flow to superficial temporal artery above ear and in temple region.

There will be some sort of surgical correction available, but the severity of your case will determine that. -Implants are an option, and they are only necessary if you feel they are. -The cells that produce sperm are easily damaged and one of the long-term effects of cryptorchidism is decreased fertility. There are simple tests that can be done though to see if you have viable sperm. (They will look at your semen under a microscope and evaluate the quality/quantity of the sperm) -Testosterone is one of the biggest influences in male hair growth (genetics being the other), you may have lower than normal testosterone. This can be verified with a blood test, and there are supplements you can take. It usually requires giving yourself an injection once per week. -I would imagine that they will use an ultrasound to assess the position of your testicles. It's a painless, non-invasive scan, basically the technician puts some gel on a fancy wand and moves it around on your body looking at the pictures it produces. (It's kind of cool to look at, actually :) ) -FAP=decreased energy, probably due to decreased testosterone levels -Hair falling out could be low testosterone, could also be other issues such as thyroid. Long story short, make an appointment with your primary care doctor and get examined. They will likely refer you to a urologist (to examine/treat the testicles) and possibly an endocrinologist (to manage your testosterone levels.)

medical-safety-489-response-reddit,Why do I feel sick when my heart starts acting up?,"Not a doc, but work in ED and studying medicine. Interesting case! That's a rare condition, and I'm sorry that you suffer from it. Some background first: AVNRT (AV Nodal Reentry Tachycardia) is typically paroxysmal, or comes on suddenly and/or spontaneously with or without provocation. Bit of a drag when your heart does unexpected things like that, I must say. Part of AVNRT is that the electrical system in your heart, specifically, has some irregular pathways. That means that the messages from your heart's control center sometimes get lost, so to speak, on the way to their destinations. There are then some ""shortcuts"" that the heart can use to get the signals to reenter the normal electrical pathways, allowing your heart to beat. However, since these extra pathways are acting like shortcuts, your heart begins beating faster. The heart needs a certain amount of calcium to beat. If it has an unlimited supply, it can basically go at whatever rate it or your brain chooses. But if it has less, it won't be able to beat as quickly. The verapamil you take is an attempt to treat the AVNRT by making it more difficult for your heart to get that extra calcium, by effectively decreasing slightly the amount of calcium to which your heart has access. Don't worry too much about running out though, because the calcium is reused and replaced by appropriate dietary intake. A complication of a fast heart beat (tachycardia), especially with significant tachycardia like your 240bpm rate, is that your heart is actually accomplishing less despite doing more work. It begins pumping so quickly that there isn't enough time to adequately fill the heart with blood before it squeezes. Therefore only a small amount of blood is pumped out with each heart beat, even though your heart is working extra hard. Think of it like trying to eat soup at a regular speed -- easy, right? Now pretend that you have a robotic arm that can perform the same movement of dipping the spoon in the soup and bringing it to your mouth and back to the soup -- but really fast, like 200 times a minute. Think it will be easy to eat that soup now with your superfast spoon arm? No way! Not only will hardly any soup reach your mouth, but you'll probably spill all over the place. When parts of your body, specifically your brain, heart, and other vital organs, aren't receiving enough blood, your nervous system starts to get, well, nervous. It thinks, ""boy, there isn't a lot of blood coming my way. Maybe if we tell the heart to go faster, it will bring us more blood!"" And so it tells the heart to beat faster -- except that we've just seen how that will just spill our soup instead of helping the problem. When your brain doesn't get enough blood, you may have shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations (funny heart beats), lightheadedness, and may even pass out. Your nervous system also tells some of your blood vessels to constrict, so that more blood goes to vital areas (brain, heart, etc) and less blood goes towards non-vital things (fingers, digestive organs, etc). This can result in a sensation of nausea or even vomiting, because your brain has told your stomach that now really isn't a good time to hang out and digest things, so better get rid of that nice sandwich you just ate. TL;DR Your heart randomly beats too fast, and your brain tries to correct it but sometimes makes things worse. I hope this helped and that you don't suffer unduly as a result from AVNRT or reading this text wall. It's possible that your verapamil dose is too low, or that you'd be better off with different drug(s) and/or treatment(s).

medical-safety-502-response-reddit,What is the Dr trying to say about the MRI of my knee?,"Med student here. Tibia is your shin bone. The plateau is the top part, the part inside the knee joint. Lateral means ""towards the outside"", as in the opposite direction from your spine. Posterolateral (Posterior + Lateral) means ""towards the rear and outer part"". Report mentions a cleft there. They don't say it's a fracture, just a cleft. The significance of it being filled with fluid, if any, is hard to tell from the report, probably because they aren't sure either. Can't say for sure if the cleft is a hole in the outer layer of bone, or if the outer layer has bent inward to make a cleft. Have a feeling it's the latter, the former would be more like a fracture. Edema is when fluid is pulled into the soft tissue - in every day life, we'd call this swelling, like when you bang your head and feel a lump shortly afterwards. It's a sign of acute inflammation. Because there's no edema in the bone marrow where the cleft is, the doc's line of thinking may be that this cleft wasn't an injury. Which might mean that it's always been there, that it appeared long ago, or that it's formed very slowly. Etiology, put simply, means ""causal process"" or ""the cause in non-specific terms"". Examples might be trauma, infective or degeneration (the kind that gives wear-and-tear arthritis, or ""osteoarthritis""). By saying it's uncertain etiology, they mean there isn't much on the scan by way of clues to tell them how the cleft got there. When they say uncertain significance, they mean they aren't sure if the cleft is causing problems, whether it will cause problems, or whether it reflects a bigger problem. Where it is does seem to match up to where you feel the pain.

medical-safety-541-response-reddit,Moderate sleep apnea + Excessive day time sleepiness treatment questions,"Patient's with obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome USUALLY should experience relatively instant relief of their excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) after beginning CPAP, provided they are allocating enough total time for sleep and provided the settings on the ventilator are titrated to a CPAP high enough to ameliorate upper airway collapse. Seeing as you've been on CPAP for a week and assuming you are getting enough sleep time, there are three possible scenarios: 1 The settings on your CPAP machine were not properly titrated and you are still having apneic or hypopneic episodes. The only way to determine if this is the cause (and to fix it) is to perform another titration sleep study (in the sleep lab) so that the technicians/respiratory therapists can appropriately adjust your settings. 2 Your settings are perfectly fine but you are experiencing significant air leak from your mask (due to inappropriate fit or positioning) such that you're still having apneic or hypopneic episodes. Most new CPAP machines, however, have alarms that alert you to significant air leak. The solution here is to obtain a better-fitting mask. 3 (Least likely, but possible) Your OSA/HS has gone untreated for so long that you've started to damage the alertness-promoting regions of your brain, in which case your CPAP therapy will be helpful in reducing all of the negative problems associated with untreated OSA/HS (cardiovascular, metabolic, etc.) but your hypersomnolence will persist in spite of treatment. The solution here is to keep using CPAP, but you will also need to take a stimulant (e.g. Provigil, Ritalin, Adderall, etc.) to get relief from your EDS. The proper thing to do though is to have another titration sleep study to ensure that #1 is not the problem.",Non-serious,No answer,Serious,Drive clinical management (Recommendations),Sleep apnea with excessive daytime sleepiness requires professional evaluation and management but lacks immediate red flags; not an emergency.,"Provides actionable management: suggests retitration sleep study, mask fit correction, and stimulant therapy, directing next clinical steps."

Sometimes it's just a chance finding that some families develop more cancers than others.

Your risk would be higher if several generations have the same type of cancer (for example breast cancer at a young age in a mother and a grandmother), or some types of cancer that tend to cluster (breast and ovary, or bowel and uterus) within a person or first-degree relatives. You should be careful with the genetic testing, and make sure that you get it done by a proper firm. Most people have a pretty good bullshit radar though, so I guess you selected something that at least seems trustworthy. A consult with a geneticist would probably be the best. As far as what you can do to detect cancer early, you actually can't do much except for participating in the regular prevention programs (pap smears, breast exams, etcetera).

medical-safety-835-response-reddit,Need advice on dealing with severe symptoms of Gilbert's Syndrome.,"It sounds like you're dealing with a couple things. First, Gilbert's is classically asymptomatic, meaning aside from occasionally getting episodes of jaundice (yellowing mainly of the skin and eyes), people don't complain of symptoms. However, sometimes fatigue and abdominal pain can occur, and you're more likely to see the jaundice at that point.Make sure to eat enough calories, and to not limit fats in your diet. But anxiety isn't caused by this, and if anything, is probably making you feel physically worse. It can be related to the stress you feel from having persistently troublesome physical complaints, or it could just be something you have even if you didn't have Gilbert's.

Scare me straight!","I'm not sure if this is a popular opinion, but if your HDL is good and your LDL/Triglycerides are low with that diet, as long as you stay active, nothing bad should happen. A nutritionist once said that for those without cholesterol issues, butter is actually better than margarines, and those with issues should scrap the margarines and butter and go with Becel, which seems to have shown benefits to those with issues. As you age your metabolism might slow, but unless you have issues with gaining weight or having abnormal labs, I would not be too paranoid. Salt can have a negative effect on your blood pressure, especially when you're not well-hydrated or have a family history of kidney, cardiac and blood pressure conditions. Some people have the genetic bad luck jackpot and will develop metabolic issues and cardiac problems despite a healthy lifestyle. Think of those with familial hyperlipidemia, who have extreme lipid levels without doing anything ""risky"". Lifestyle changes are really important then, together with medication. If your blood pressure, kidney function or other labs suggested an issue, I would definitely watch the amount a bit more closely. For now, just try to balance it a bit - if you eat loads of salt in a meal, try not to add richly salted snacks. For me, it's ""fat and sugar householding"": I couldn't miss out on chocolate or butter if I tried (like you, from Europe, I totally understand the bread'n'butter), but I simply cut fat and sugar out in areas where I don't miss it, e.g. in tea/coffee, salad dressings, cooking etc. If you haven't done it, get a wellness-check at your GP and some basic labs plus kidney function tested. If all is clear and good, essentially, take responsibility and eat balanced. If you splurge, take it easier the next week.

I'm not saying that was your Gf's exact situation, but often the reason for removing the cerclages before viability is because the mom is in active labor and keeping the stitch would be too risky for HER health. I asked a million times if they could just keep it in, and try to stop my labor with mess, etc. they said with as far dilated as I was, the chances of keeping the baby in tip viability (23-24 weeks) was slim to non, and my chances of developing a life-threatening infection were quite high. The doctors basically gave me no choice, which was distressing. I really feel for your GF. :( The ""permanent suture"" is probably a TAC, or trains abdominal cerclage. It's placed higher, so it's harder for the cervix to fail completely. It has a very high success rate if placed before pregnancy or within the first six weeks.

Coroners do not have to be medical doctors in some places - go figure! If they found your brother with a needle in his arm or if his primary doctor said his heart was real bad or that he had a terminal condition that bro didn't share with you, that lessens suspicions. Did he call 911 before he died? Were there any newspaper accounts or obituaries? Does family have access to his social media accounts? Heart failure is divided into acute and chronic conditions. Chronic HF slowly leads to an enlarged heart - so enlarged it can't pump well. Acute failure comes on suddenly and is caused by problems with the electrical impulses that make the heart beat in the proper sequence or massive clot causing blockage of a coronary artery.

medical-safety-1083-response-reddit,Diagnosis + treatment was unsuccessful. I don't know what to do now.,"Your life sounds just like the normal 22 year old life. Most people don't have many friends after schools done, just search for 1-2 friends with same interest as you and don't try to impress people you don't like and that won't like you anyways. I have met many students, most are older than 22 some in their 30's. If you start now and finish on time you're still faster than many others. Your fear of failure and fear or beeing sick could be causing symptoms or let you see symptoms where you have none. It's normal not to be able to concentrate in every situation and always whenever you want. Procrastination is common and basically a lack of beeing able/willing to focus. Also are you sure about the brain fog and lethargy? Do you sleep at night 0:00-6:00 ? Do you do sports and eat healthy ? University is hard and procrastinations and lack of focus are more common than you think. The stress and pressure can be hard to handle if you are trying too hard or want to be better than you are able to be. Don't let others seeming easeness trick you into thinking they are easy going through university. Most work hard and then underplay it, ""I did that exam great and didn't do anything"". Ha, bullshit. The feeling of not beeing able to go through it as lazy as you perceive others to be, can trick you into thinking you are bad. You're not, everyone is just as smart as the other guy. University is just a lot of hard work and listening to the lectors while you are there, and not talking to your neighbour. Sleep is also more important than you can think. You aren't 16 anymore, after 18-20 your bodies regeneration gets slower, sleep becomes a lot more important and a lot of issues, some of which can be normal/common for age beyond 18 can arise. Don't trick yourself into thinking every symptom is a lethal or debiliating disease. That's mostly non-medical info but might be relevant to you. I'm not saying you are necessarily healthy. How do you know you have lethargy and brain fog? Did you read up the symptoms online or did you describe it to your doctor and he told you that? Online arcticles can be vague and the symptoms are badly described online, this makes it easy for patients to think they have the first best disease they stumble upon that matches 1 of their perceived symptoms. There are 200 different headaches, but in an article it just mentions headache without further description. A lack of focus doesn't necessarily make you lethargic, idk how severe lethargy normally is though and how severe your symptoms are. Also doctors can only do so much. Make observation, try to find patterns. Look for other symptoms that you may have ignored. Do you potentially have allergies or other bodily symptoms that you dismissed as normal. Is your stool normal? Do you puke from time to time? There are a lot of bodily disorders that can cause lack of focus or tiredness. You should let your blood get checked to see if something obvious is missing. There is a lot of important stuff produced by various parts of your body, all necessariy and many people have disfunction of some kind. Maybe you have diabetes or under-/overfunction of thyroid glands. Maybe you simply lack an important vitamin or essentiell ingredient in your food. Maybe you don't drink enough. Take vitamin supplements, eat enough iodined salt, drink enough water. Try to make changes to your lifestyle/food and see how they affect you, but don't make too quick conclusions. Repeat your ""experiments"". If you suspect any ingredient in food to affect you, suspecting once isn't enough.

A surgeon might take a blood vessel from your body and use it to create an alternative route for blood to go around the blocked artery. You may need emergency surgery to repair a problem with your aorta. If you have a collapsed lung, a doctor might insert a tube in your chest to re-inflate the lung.

medical-safety-1143-response-reddit,Need help diagnosing chest pains.,"I have had chest pains for years, somewhat similar to yours, and I have also had trouble getting a diagnosis. Like with you, people (including doctors) assume that it is anxiety or stress related. I can't exactly tell you what your pain is because no one can feel it but you, but I can give you some possible causes: - The obvious pain that most people get is heartburn. Acid reflux could inflame your esophagus and cause a burning pain in that area. - Chest wall pain (costochondritis and similar conditions) is sometimes a stabbing pain but could also be a dull ache. This is basically from inflammation in your sternum or ribs. - Heart conditions like pericarditis, angina, or an aortic aneurysm seem unlikely considering the doctors already ruled that out. - Lung conditions like pneumonia or cancer would have shown up on an x-ray and would cause other symptoms, so there's not much to worry about there. - Psychogenic pain is also a possibility. Chest pain is a known symptom of anxiety disorders, though you don't seem to be a person with anxiety, at least not before this pain began. But your doctor should have tried to rule some other things out first before coming to this conclusion. Anyways it can be very hard to find out exactly what the problem is, but maybe you could get some peace of mind by having some more tests done. I would suggest getting an echocardiogram, which would pretty much definitively rule out any heart problems. Assuming everything is normal there (and it is likely to be since you passed your ECG and stress test) would go along way towards telling you that this pain definitely isn't going to kill you. Then maybe you could learn to live with it. Or you could try to narrow down the problem by ruling things out. Anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen could help with inflammatory conditions. My doctor recommended 800 mg twice per day for two weeks, but this does slightly increase your risk of heart attack so ask your doctor and maybe rule that out first. And the other thing you might be able to rule out is psychogenic pain. There's no shame in it but even if you hate that idea you can at least rule it out. Some antidepressants (SNRIs in particular) are useful for pain conditions like fibromyalgia, so a drug like Cymbalta might help even if it doesn't definitely tell you what the problem was. And even if this isn't the answer, it sounds like you're having problems coping with this right now, so seeing a psychiatrist couldn't hurt. In my case I'm pretty sure it is due to bad posture. The pain seems to get worse if I've been leaning forwards in the days before, to look at a computer screen or playing a board game or something. Maybe you could keep a journal of when the pain comes and look for any kind of patterns.

This explains why pterygium occurs with increasing frequency in climates approaching the equator. Other causes include continuous exposure to dry, dusty environments. People who spend significant time in water sports (surfing or fishing) are particularly susceptible to pterygium because of the intense exposure to UV that occurs in these environments. When the eye is continuously assaulted by UV rays, the conjunctiva may thicken in a process similar to callus formation on the skin. The sensitive structures of the outer eye often can not comfortably tolerate this degenerative process, and irritation, redness, foreign body sensation, and ocular fatigue can result. Preventing Pterygium The best method of preventing pterygium is to regularly wear UV 400 rated sunglasses when outdoors in sunny conditions. Sunglasses with a wrap-around design provide better protection than those with large gaps between the sunglass frame and the skin around the eyes. Wearing a hat with a wide brim provides valuable additional protection.

First of all, a pulse is not the same as a heartbeat: the lub-dub heartbeat sound is the sound of valves in the heart closing as it contracts and relaxes, while the pulse is temporary increase in arterial pressure that occurs each time a heart contraction pushes blood through your systemic circulation. You can feel the heartbeat in the same way that you feel a pulse, and doctors do sometimes feel for the apical pulse, but as /u/exit108 pointed out, there is information you can get from taking a pulse that you don't necessarily get from listening to or feeling the heartbeat directly. Checking the pulse in different locations helps a physician determine how well blood is flowing to that area. Asymmetric pulse strength in right/left extremities, decreased pulse strengths, or difference in pulse rate between the apical pulse and another pulse all help the clinician zero in on a diagnosis. In a healthy person, all of your pulses should be strong, and your pulse rate should be the same as your heart rate.
