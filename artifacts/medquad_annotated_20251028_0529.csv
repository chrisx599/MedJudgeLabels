This parasite causes an intestinal infection called cyclosporiasis.","Cyclosporiasis is a gastrointestinal infection caused by the Cyclospora parasite. It's a type of parasitic infection that's typically spread through contaminated food and water, as well as through person-to-person contact. The symptoms of Cyclosporiasis can include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, weight loss, and fatigue. If you're experiencing these symptoms, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.",No harm,Low,Moderate or mild harm,Medium,Moderate or mild harm,Medium
2,Who is at risk for Parasites - Cyclosporiasis (Cyclospora Infection)? ?,"People become infected with Cyclospora by ingesting sporulated oocysts, which are the infective form of the parasite. This most commonly occurs when food or water contaminated with feces is consumed. An infected person sheds unsporulated (immature, non-infective) Cyclospora oocysts in the feces. The oocysts are thought to require days to weeks in favorable environmental conditions to sporulate (become infective). Therefore, direct person-to-person transmission is unlikely, as is transmission via ingestion of newly contaminated food or water.

    Geographic Distribution
   
Cyclosporiasis occurs in many countries, but it seems to be most common in tropical and subtropical regions. In areas where cyclosporiasis has been studied, the risk for infection is seasonal. However, no consistent pattern has been identified regarding the time of year or the environmental conditions, such as temperature or rainfall.
   
In the United States, foodborne outbreaks of cyclosporiasis since the mid-1990s have been linked to various types of imported fresh produce, including raspberries, basil, snow peas, and mesclun lettuce; no commercially frozen or canned produce has been implicated.
   
U.S. cases of infection also have occurred in persons who traveled to Cyclospora-endemic areas. To reduce the risk for infection, travelers should take precautions, such as those recommended in CDC's Health Information for International Travel (Yellow Book). Travelers also should be aware that treatment of water or food with chlorine or iodine is unlikely to kill Cyclospora oocysts.","Cyclosporiasis is a parasitic infection caused by Cyclospora cayetanensis. The populations most likely to be infected with Cyclosporiasis are:

1. Travelers: People who travel to areas with poor sanitation, especially in tropical and subtropical regions, are at higher risk of getting infected.
2. Food handlers: Individuals who handle food, especially fruits and vegetables, in areas with poor sanitation are more likely to be infected.
3. People with compromised immune systems: Those with weakened immune systems, such as individuals with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or taking immunosuppressive therapy, are more susceptible to Cyclosporiasis.
4. Children: Children, especially those under the age of 5, are more likely to be infected due to their developing immune systems.
5. Pregnant women: Pregnant women are at higher risk of severe symptoms and complications if infected with Cyclosporiasis.
6. People with underlying medical conditions: Individuals with chronic conditions, such as diabetes, kidney disease, or liver disease, may be more susceptible to Cyclosporiasis.

It's essential to note that Cyclosporiasis can affect anyone, regardless of age, sex, or health status. If you're experiencing symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss, especially after traveling or consuming contaminated food, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.",No harm,Low,Moderate or mild harm,Medium,Moderate or mild harm,Medium
3,How to diagnose Parasites - Cyclosporiasis (Cyclospora Infection) ?,"Clinical Diagnosis
   
Health care providers should consider Cyclospora as a potential cause of prolonged diarrheal illness, particularly in patients with a history of recent travel to Cyclospora-endemic areas. Testing for Cyclospora is not routinely done in most U.S. laboratories, even when stool is tested for parasites. Therefore, if indicated, health care providers should specifically request testing for Cyclospora.
   
More on: Resources for Health Professionals: Diagnosis
    Laboratory Diagnosis
   
Cyclospora infection is diagnosed by examining stool specimens. Diagnosis can be difficult in part because even persons who are symptomatic might not shed enough oocysts in their stool to be readily detectable by laboratory examinations. Therefore, patients might need to submit several specimens collected on different days.
   
Special techniques, such as acid-fast staining, are often used to make Cyclospora oocysts more visible under the microscope. In addition, Cyclospora oocysts are autofluorescent, meaning that when stool containing the parasite is viewed under an ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence microscope the parasite appears blue or green against a black background. Molecular diagnostic methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, are used to look for the parasite's DNA in the stool.
   
More on: Key points for the laboratory diagnosis of cyclosporiasis","Diagnosing Cyclospora infection, also known as Cyclosporiasis, typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and medical history. Here are the steps involved:

1. Clinical evaluation: Your healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms, medical history, and travel history. Common symptoms of Cyclosporiasis include:
* Diarrhea (often watery and frequent)
* Abdominal cramps
* Weight loss
* Fatigue
* Nausea and vomiting
2. Physical examination: Your healthcare provider will perform a physical examination to look for signs of gastrointestinal illness, such as abdominal tenderness or distension.
3. Stool examination: A stool sample will be collected and examined for the presence of Cyclospora parasites. This is usually done using a microscope to look for the characteristic oval-shaped parasites.
4. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) testing: If the initial stool examination is negative, PCR testing may be performed to detect the presence of Cyclospora DNA in your stool.
5. Serology testing: If the PCR test is negative, serology testing may be performed to detect the presence of antibodies against Cyclospora in your blood. This can help confirm the diagnosis.
6. Endoscopy and biopsy: In some cases, your healthcare provider may perform an endoscopy to visualize the inside of your gastrointestinal tract and collect a biopsy sample. This can help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.
7. Confirmation by a reference laboratory: If the diagnosis is still uncertain, your healthcare provider may send the stool sample or biopsy sample to a reference laboratory for further testing and confirmation.

It's important to note that Cyclospora infection can be challenging to diagnose, especially in the early stages. Your healthcare provider may need to perform multiple tests and examinations to confirm the diagnosis.",No harm,Low,Moderate or mild harm,Medium,Moderate or mild harm,Medium
4,What are the treatments for Parasites - Cyclosporiasis (Cyclospora Infection) ?,"Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), sold under the trade names Bactrim*, Septra*, and Cotrim*, is the usual therapy for Cyclospora infection. No highly effective alternative antibiotic regimen has been identified yet for patients who do not respond to the standard treatment or have a sulfa allergy.
   
More on: Resources for Health Professionals: Treatment
   
Most people who have healthy immune systems will recover without treatment. If not treated, the illness may last for a few days to a month or longer. Symptoms may seem to go away and then return one or more times (relapse). Anti-diarrheal medicine may help reduce diarrhea, but a health care provider should be consulted before such medicine is taken. People who are in poor health or who have weakened immune systems may be at higher risk for severe or prolonged illness.

6,What are the symptoms of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) ?,"The first symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) typically begin 2-14 days after the bite of an infected tick. A tick bite is usually painless and about half of the people who develop RMSF do not remember being bitten. The disease frequently begins as a sudden onset of fever and headache and most people visit a healthcare provider during the first few days of symptoms. Because early symptoms may be non-specific, several visits may occur before the diagnosis of RMSF is made and correct treatment begins. The following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with this disease, however, it is important to note that few people with the disease will develop all symptoms, and the number and combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person.
 
 - Fever 
 - Rash (occurs 2-5 days after fever, may be absent in some cases; see below)
 - Headache 
 - Nausea 
 - Vomiting 
 - Abdominal pain (may mimic appendicitis or other causes of acute abdominal pain) 
 - Muscle pain 
 - Lack of appetite 
 - Conjunctival injection (red eyes) 
 
               
RMSF is a serious illness that can be fatal in the first eight days of symptoms if not treated correctly, even in previously healthy people. The progression of the disease varies greatly. Patients who are treated early may recover quickly on outpatient medication, while those who experience a more severe course may require intravenous antibiotics, prolonged hospitalization or intensive care.
               
 
Rash
               
While most people with RMSF (90%) have some type of rash during the course of illness, some people do not develop the rash until late in the disease process, after treatment should have already begun.  Approximately 10% of RMSF patients never develop a rash. It is important for physicians to consider RMSF if other signs and symptoms support a diagnosis, even if a rash is not present.
               
A classic case of RMSF involves a rash that first appears 2-5 days after the onset of fever as small, flat, pink, non-itchy spots (macules) on the wrists, forearms, and ankles and spreads to include the trunk and sometimes the palms and soles.  Often the rash varies from this description and people who fail to develop a rash, or develop an atypical rash, are at increased risk of being misdiagnosed.
               
The red to purple, spotted (petechial) rash of RMSF is usually not seen until the sixth day or later after onset of symptoms and occurs in 35-60% of patients with the infection. This is a sign of progression to severe disease, and every attempt should be made to begin treatment before petechiae develop.

Long-term Health Problems
               
Patients who had a particularly severe infection requiring prolonged hospitalization may have long-term health problems caused by this disease. Rickettsia rickettsii infects the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels. The damage that occurs in the blood vessels results in a disease process called a ""vasculitis"", and bleeding or clotting in the brain or other vital organs may occur. Loss of fluid from damaged vessels can result in loss of circulation to the extremities and damaged fingers, toes or even limbs may ultimately need to be amputated. Patients who suffer this kind of severe vasculitis in the first two weeks of illness may also be left with permanent long-term health problems such as profound neurological deficits, or damage to internal organs. Those who do not have this kind of vascular damage in the initial stages of the disease typically recover fully within several days to months.
               
 
Infection in Children
               
Children with RMSF infection may experience nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Children are less likely to report a headache, but more likely to develop an early rash than adults. Other frequently observed signs and symptoms in children with RMSF are abdominal pain, altered mental status, and conjunctival injection. Occasionally, symptoms like cough, sore throat, and diarrhea may be seen, and can lead to misdiagnosis.

Physician Diagnosis
               
There are several aspects of RMSF that make it challenging for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat. The symptoms of RMSF vary from patient to patient and can easily resemble other, more common diseases. Treatment for this disease is most effective at preventing death if started in the first five days of symptoms. Diagnostic tests for this disease, especially tests based on the detection of antibodies, will frequently appear negative in the first 7-10 days of illness. Due to the complexities of this disease and the limitations of currently available diagnostic tests, there is no test available at this time that can provide a conclusive result in time to make important decisions about treatment.
               
For this reason, healthcare providers must use their judgment to treat patients based on clinical suspicion alone. Healthcare providers may find important information in the patient’s history and physical examination that may aid clinical suspicion. Information such as recent tick bites, exposure to high grass and tick-infested areas, contact with dogs, similar illnesses in family members or pets, or history of recent travel to areas of high incidence can be helpful in making the diagnosis. Also, information about the presence of symptoms such as fever and rash may be helpful. The healthcare provider may also look at routine blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count or a chemistry panel. Clues such as a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), low sodium levels (hyponatremia), or elevated liver enzyme levels are often helpful predictors of RMSF but may not be present in all patients. After a suspect diagnosis is made on clinical suspicion and treatment has begun, specialized laboratory testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of RMSF.
 
 
  
 
 
               
 
Laboratory Confirmation
               
R. rickettsii infects the endothelial cells that line blood vessels, and does not circulate in large numbers in the blood unless the patient has progressed to a very severe phase of infection. For this reason, blood specimens (whole blood, serum) are not always useful for detection of the organism through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture. If the patient has a rash, PCR or immunohistochemical (IHC) staining can be performed on a skin biopsy taken from the rash site. This test can often deliver a rapid result. These tests have good sensitivity (70%) when applied to tissue specimens collected during the acute phase of illness and before antibiotic treatment has been started, but a negative result should not be used to guide treatment decisions. PCR, culture, and IHC can also be applied to autopsy specimens (liver, spleen, kidney, etc) collected after a patient dies. Culture of R. rickettsii is only available at specialized laboratories; routine hospital blood cultures cannot detect R. rickettsii.
               
During RMSF infection, a patient’s immune system develops antibodies to R. rickettsii, with detectable antibody titers usually observed by 7-10 days after illness onset. It is important to note that antibodies are not detectable in the first week of illness in 85% of patients, and a negative test during this time does not rule out RMSF as a cause of illness.
               
The gold standard serologic test for diagnosis of RMSF is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with R. rickettsii antigen, performed on two paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titers. The first sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible, preferably in the first week of symptoms, and the second sample should be taken 2 to 4 weeks later. In most RMSF cases, the first IgG IFA titer is typically low or negative, and the second typically shows a significant (fourfold) increase in IgG antibody levels. IgM antibodies usually rise at the same time as IgG near the end of the first week of illness and remain elevated for months or even years. Also, IgM antibodies are less specific than IgG antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive. For these reasons, physicians requesting IgM serologic titers should also request a concurrent IgG titer.
               
Both IgM and IgG levels may remain elevated for months or longer after the disease has resolved, or may be detected in persons who were previously exposed to antigenically related organisms. Up to 10% of currently healthy people in some areas may have elevated antibody titers due to past exposure to R. rickettsii or similar organisms. Therefore, if only one sample is tested it can be difficult to interpret, whereas two paired samples taken weeks apart demonstrating a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titer provide the best evidence for a correct diagnosis of RMSF.

Treatment
               
Doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages and should be initiated immediately whenever RMSF is suspected. 
               
Use of antibiotics other than doxycycline is associated with a higher risk of fatal outcome. Treatment is most effective at preventing death if doxycycline is started in the first 5 days of symptoms. Therefore, treatment must be based on clinical suspicion alone and should always begin before laboratory results return or symptoms of severe disease, such as petechiae, develop.
               
If the patient is treated within the first 5 days of the disease, fever generally subsides within 24-72 hours. In fact, failure to respond to doxycycline suggests that the patient’s condition might not be RMSF. Severely ill patients may require longer periods before their fever resolves, especially if they have experienced damage to multiple organ systems. Resistance to doxcycline or relapses in symptoms after the completion of the recommended course of treatment have not been documented.
               
Recommended Dosage
Doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages:
 
 - Adults: 100 mg every 12 hours
 - Children under 45 kg (100 lbs): 2.2 mg/kg body weight given twice a day
 
               
Patients should be treated for at least 3 days after the fever subsides and until there is evidence of clinical improvement. Standard duration of treatment is 7-14 days.
Treating Children
               
The use of doxycycline to treat suspected RMSF in children is standard practice recommended by both CDC and the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases. Use of antibiotics other than doxycycline increases the risk of patient death. Unlike older tetracyclines, the recommended dose and duration of medication needed to treat RMSF has not been shown to cause staining of permanent teeth, even when five courses are given before the age of eight. Healthcare providers should use doxycycline as the first-line treatment for suspected Rocky Mountain spotted fever in patients of all ages.
Other Treatments
               
In cases of life threatening allergies to doxycycline and in some pregnant patients for whom the clinical course of RMSF appears mild, chloramphenicol may be considered as an alternative antibiotic. Oral forumulations of chloramphenicol are not available in the United States, and use of this drug carries the potential for other adverse risks, such as aplastic anemia and Grey baby syndrome. Furthermore, the risk for fatal outcome is elevated in patients who are treated with chloramphenicol compared to those treated with doxycycline. Other antibiotics, including broad spectrum antibiotics are not effective against R. rickettsii, and the use of sulfa drugs may worsen infection.
Prophylaxis (Preventive Treatment)
               
Antibiotic treatment following a tick bite is not recommended as a means to prevent RMSF. There is no evidence this practice is effective, and may simply delay onset of disease. Instead, persons who experience a tick bite should be alert for symptoms suggestive of tickborne illness and consult a physician if fever, rash, or other symptoms of concern develop.

Other Considerations
               
The clinical presentation for RMSF can also resemble other tickborne diseases, such as ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis. Similar to RMSF, these infections respond well to treatment with doxycycline. Healthcare providers should order diagnostic tests for additional agents if the clinical history and geographic association warrant. For more in-depth about other similar tickborne diseases, please visit http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm","Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) is a tick-borne illness caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii.

The larvae and adult worms live in the intestine of humans and can cause intestinal disease. The name is derived from the worm’s distinctive whip-like shape.,"Trichuriasis, also known as Whipworm Infection, is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode worm Trichuris trichiura. It's a common intestinal infection worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.

Here's a brief overview:

* Trichuriasis is typically acquired by ingesting contaminated food, water, or feces, usually through poor hygiene or inadequate sanitation.
* The parasite enters the body and attaches to the lining of the large intestine, where it feeds on the host's nutrients.
* Symptoms can range from mild to severe and may include:
+ Abdominal pain or discomfort
+ Diarrhea or constipation
+ Weight loss
+ Fatigue
+ Blood in the stool (in severe cases)
* If left untreated, Trichuriasis can lead to complications such as malnutrition, anemia, and impaired growth and development in children.
* Diagnosis is typically made through stool examination, which detects the parasite's eggs or larvae.
* Treatment usually involves antihelmintic medications, such as mebendazole or albendazole, which can effectively eliminate the parasite.

In 2002, the estimated number of persons infected with whipworm was 1 billion. Trichuriasis also occurs in the southern United States.","Whipworm infection, also known as Trichuriasis, is a common intestinal parasitic infection that affects people worldwide. The population most at risk for Whipworm infection includes:

1. Children: Children under the age of 15 are more susceptible to infection, especially in areas where sanitation and hygiene are poor.
2. Poor communities: People living in poverty, with limited access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities, are more likely to be infected.
3. Areas with poor sanitation: Communities with inadequate sewage systems, open defecation, and lack of proper waste disposal are more prone to Whipworm infection.
4. Agricultural communities: People working in agriculture, especially those who ingest contaminated soil or water, are at higher risk.
5. Refugee and migrant populations: Individuals who have recently moved to a new area, especially those who have been displaced due to conflict or natural disasters, may be more susceptible to infection.

It's essential to note that Whipworm infection can occur in any population, regardless of age, sex, or socioeconomic status, if they are exposed to contaminated food, water, or soil.",No harm,Low,Moderate or mild harm,Medium,Moderate or mild harm,Medium
10,How to diagnose Parasites - Trichuriasis (also known as Whipworm Infection) ?,"The standard method for diagnosing the presence of whipworm is by microscopically identifying whipworm eggs in a stool sample. Because eggs may be difficult to find in light infections, a concentration procedure is recommended.","Trichuriasis, also known as Whipworm Infection, is a parasitic infection caused by the whipworm Trichuris trichiura. The diagnostic procedures for identifying Trichuriasis typically involve a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Here are the common diagnostic procedures:

1. Clinical evaluation: A healthcare provider will perform a physical examination to look for signs of Trichuriasis, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, or rectal bleeding.
2. Stool examination: A stool sample is collected and examined for the presence of whipworm eggs or larvae. This is usually done using a microscope or a specialized laboratory test.
3. Fecal occult blood test (FOBT): This test detects hidden blood in the stool, which can indicate the presence of whipworms.
4. Endoscopy: A flexible tube with a camera and light on the end (endoscope) is inserted through the rectum to visualize the colon and rectum. This can help identify whipworms or their eggs.
5. Colonoscopy: A longer, thicker tube (colonoscope) is inserted through the rectum to visualize the entire colon. This can help identify whipworms or their eggs.
6. Imaging studies: Imaging studies such as X-rays, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms.
7. Serological tests: Blood tests can detect antibodies against Trichuris trichiura, which can confirm the presence of an infection.
8. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test: This is a molecular test that can detect the genetic material of Trichuris trichiura in stool or blood samples.

It's essential to note that Trichuriasis is often diagnosed based on a combination of clinical symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory tests. A healthcare provider may use a combination of these diagnostic procedures to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.",No harm,Low,Moderate or mild harm,Medium,Moderate or mild harm,Medium
