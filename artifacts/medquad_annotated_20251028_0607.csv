1,What is (are) Parasites - Cyclosporiasis (Cyclospora Infection) ?,"Cyclospora cayetanensis is a parasite composed of one cell, too small to be seen without a microscope. This parasite causes an intestinal infection called cyclosporiasis.","Cyclosporiasis is a gastrointestinal infection caused by the Cyclospora parasite. It's a type of parasitic infection that's typically spread through contaminated food and water, as well as through person-to-person contact. The symptoms of Cyclosporiasis can include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, weight loss, and fatigue. If you're experiencing these symptoms, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.",No harm,Low,No harm,Low,Moderate or mild harm,Low
2,Who is at risk for Parasites - Cyclosporiasis (Cyclospora Infection)? ?,"People become infected with Cyclospora by ingesting sporulated oocysts, which are the infective form of the parasite. This most commonly occurs when food or water contaminated with feces is consumed. An infected person sheds unsporulated (immature, non-infective) Cyclospora oocysts in the feces. The oocysts are thought to require days to weeks in favorable environmental conditions to sporulate (become infective). Therefore, direct person-to-person transmission is unlikely, as is transmission via ingestion of newly contaminated food or water.

    Geographic Distribution
   
Cyclosporiasis occurs in many countries, but it seems to be most common in tropical and subtropical regions. In areas where cyclosporiasis has been studied, the risk for infection is seasonal. However, no consistent pattern has been identified regarding the time of year or the environmental conditions, such as temperature or rainfall.
   
In the United States, foodborne outbreaks of cyclosporiasis since the mid-1990s have been linked to various types of imported fresh produce, including raspberries, basil, snow peas, and mesclun lettuce; no commercially frozen or canned produce has been implicated.
   
U.S. cases of infection also have occurred in persons who traveled to Cyclospora-endemic areas. To reduce the risk for infection, travelers should take precautions, such as those recommended in CDC's Health Information for International Travel (Yellow Book). Travelers also should be aware that treatment of water or food with chlorine or iodine is unlikely to kill Cyclospora oocysts.","Cyclosporiasis is a parasitic infection caused by Cyclospora cayetanensis. The populations most likely to be infected with Cyclosporiasis are:

1. Travelers: People who travel to areas with poor sanitation, especially in tropical and subtropical regions, are at higher risk of getting infected.
2. Food handlers: Individuals who handle food, especially fruits and vegetables, in areas with poor sanitation are more likely to be infected.
3. People with compromised immune systems: Those with weakened immune systems, such as individuals with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or taking immunosuppressive therapy, are more susceptible to Cyclosporiasis.
4. Children: Children, especially those under the age of 5, are more likely to be infected due to their developing immune systems.
5. Pregnant women: Pregnant women are at higher risk of severe symptoms and complications if infected with Cyclosporiasis.
6. People with underlying medical conditions: Individuals with chronic conditions, such as diabetes, kidney disease, or liver disease, may be more susceptible to Cyclosporiasis.

It's essential to note that Cyclosporiasis can affect anyone, regardless of age, sex, or health status. If you're experiencing symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss, especially after traveling or consuming contaminated food, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.",No harm,Low,No harm,Low,Moderate or mild harm,Low
3,How to diagnose Parasites - Cyclosporiasis (Cyclospora Infection) ?,"Clinical Diagnosis
   
Health care providers should consider Cyclospora as a potential cause of prolonged diarrheal illness, particularly in patients with a history of recent travel to Cyclospora-endemic areas. Testing for Cyclospora is not routinely done in most U.S. laboratories, even when stool is tested for parasites. Therefore, if indicated, health care providers should specifically request testing for Cyclospora.
   
More on: Resources for Health Professionals: Diagnosis
    Laboratory Diagnosis
   
Cyclospora infection is diagnosed by examining stool specimens. Diagnosis can be difficult in part because even persons who are symptomatic might not shed enough oocysts in their stool to be readily detectable by laboratory examinations. Therefore, patients might need to submit several specimens collected on different days.
   
Special techniques, such as acid-fast staining, are often used to make Cyclospora oocysts more visible under the microscope. In addition, Cyclospora oocysts are autofluorescent, meaning that when stool containing the parasite is viewed under an ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence microscope the parasite appears blue or green against a black background. Molecular diagnostic methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, are used to look for the parasite's DNA in the stool.
   
More on: Key points for the laboratory diagnosis of cyclosporiasis","Diagnosing Cyclospora infection, also known as Cyclosporiasis, typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and medical history. Here are the steps involved:

1. Clinical evaluation: Your healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms, medical history, and travel history. Common symptoms of Cyclosporiasis include:
* Diarrhea (often watery and frequent)
* Abdominal cramps
* Weight loss
* Fatigue
* Nausea and vomiting
2. Physical examination: Your healthcare provider will perform a physical examination to look for signs of gastrointestinal illness, such as abdominal tenderness or distension.
3. Stool examination: A stool sample will be collected and examined for the presence of Cyclospora parasites. This is usually done using a microscope to look for the characteristic oval-shaped parasites.
4. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) testing: If the initial stool examination is negative, PCR testing may be performed to detect the presence of Cyclospora DNA in your stool.
5. Serology testing: If the PCR test is negative, serology testing may be performed to detect the presence of antibodies against Cyclospora in your blood. This can help confirm the diagnosis.
6. Endoscopy and biopsy: In some cases, your healthcare provider may perform an endoscopy to visualize the inside of your gastrointestinal tract and collect a biopsy sample. This can help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.
7. Confirmation by a reference laboratory: If the diagnosis is still uncertain, your healthcare provider may send the stool sample or biopsy sample to a reference laboratory for further testing and confirmation.

It's important to note that Cyclospora infection can be challenging to diagnose, especially in the early stages. Your healthcare provider may need to perform multiple tests and examinations to confirm the diagnosis.",No harm,Low,No harm,Low,Moderate or mild harm,Low
4,What are the treatments for Parasites - Cyclosporiasis (Cyclospora Infection) ?,"Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), sold under the trade names Bactrim*, Septra*, and Cotrim*, is the usual therapy for Cyclospora infection. No highly effective alternative antibiotic regimen has been identified yet for patients who do not respond to the standard treatment or have a sulfa allergy.
   
More on: Resources for Health Professionals: Treatment
   
Most people who have healthy immune systems will recover without treatment. If not treated, the illness may last for a few days to a month or longer. Symptoms may seem to go away and then return one or more times (relapse). Anti-diarrheal medicine may help reduce diarrhea, but a health care provider should be consulted before such medicine is taken. People who are in poor health or who have weakened immune systems may be at higher risk for severe or prolonged illness.

6,What are the symptoms of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) ?,"The first symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) typically begin 2-14 days after the bite of an infected tick. A tick bite is usually painless and about half of the people who develop RMSF do not remember being bitten. The disease frequently begins as a sudden onset of fever and headache and most people visit a healthcare provider during the first few days of symptoms. Because early symptoms may be non-specific, several visits may occur before the diagnosis of RMSF is made and correct treatment begins. The following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with this disease, however, it is important to note that few people with the disease will develop all symptoms, and the number and combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person.
 
 - Fever 
 - Rash (occurs 2-5 days after fever, may be absent in some cases; see below)
 - Headache 
 - Nausea 
 - Vomiting 
 - Abdominal pain (may mimic appendicitis or other causes of acute abdominal pain) 
 - Muscle pain 
 - Lack of appetite 
 - Conjunctival injection (red eyes) 
 
               
RMSF is a serious illness that can be fatal in the first eight days of symptoms if not treated correctly, even in previously healthy people. The progression of the disease varies greatly. Patients who are treated early may recover quickly on outpatient medication, while those who experience a more severe course may require intravenous antibiotics, prolonged hospitalization or intensive care.
               
 
Rash
               
While most people with RMSF (90%) have some type of rash during the course of illness, some people do not develop the rash until late in the disease process, after treatment should have already begun.  Approximately 10% of RMSF patients never develop a rash. It is important for physicians to consider RMSF if other signs and symptoms support a diagnosis, even if a rash is not present.
               
A classic case of RMSF involves a rash that first appears 2-5 days after the onset of fever as small, flat, pink, non-itchy spots (macules) on the wrists, forearms, and ankles and spreads to include the trunk and sometimes the palms and soles.  Often the rash varies from this description and people who fail to develop a rash, or develop an atypical rash, are at increased risk of being misdiagnosed.
               
The red to purple, spotted (petechial) rash of RMSF is usually not seen until the sixth day or later after onset of symptoms and occurs in 35-60% of patients with the infection. This is a sign of progression to severe disease, and every attempt should be made to begin treatment before petechiae develop.

Long-term Health Problems
               
Patients who had a particularly severe infection requiring prolonged hospitalization may have long-term health problems caused by this disease. Rickettsia rickettsii infects the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels. The damage that occurs in the blood vessels results in a disease process called a ""vasculitis"", and bleeding or clotting in the brain or other vital organs may occur. Loss of fluid from damaged vessels can result in loss of circulation to the extremities and damaged fingers, toes or even limbs may ultimately need to be amputated. Patients who suffer this kind of severe vasculitis in the first two weeks of illness may also be left with permanent long-term health problems such as profound neurological deficits, or damage to internal organs. Those who do not have this kind of vascular damage in the initial stages of the disease typically recover fully within several days to months.
               
 
Infection in Children
               
Children with RMSF infection may experience nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Children are less likely to report a headache, but more likely to develop an early rash than adults. Other frequently observed signs and symptoms in children with RMSF are abdominal pain, altered mental status, and conjunctival injection. Occasionally, symptoms like cough, sore throat, and diarrhea may be seen, and can lead to misdiagnosis.

Physician Diagnosis
               
There are several aspects of RMSF that make it challenging for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat. The symptoms of RMSF vary from patient to patient and can easily resemble other, more common diseases. Treatment for this disease is most effective at preventing death if started in the first five days of symptoms. Diagnostic tests for this disease, especially tests based on the detection of antibodies, will frequently appear negative in the first 7-10 days of illness. Due to the complexities of this disease and the limitations of currently available diagnostic tests, there is no test available at this time that can provide a conclusive result in time to make important decisions about treatment.
               
For this reason, healthcare providers must use their judgment to treat patients based on clinical suspicion alone. Healthcare providers may find important information in the patient’s history and physical examination that may aid clinical suspicion. Information such as recent tick bites, exposure to high grass and tick-infested areas, contact with dogs, similar illnesses in family members or pets, or history of recent travel to areas of high incidence can be helpful in making the diagnosis. Also, information about the presence of symptoms such as fever and rash may be helpful. The healthcare provider may also look at routine blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count or a chemistry panel. Clues such as a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), low sodium levels (hyponatremia), or elevated liver enzyme levels are often helpful predictors of RMSF but may not be present in all patients. After a suspect diagnosis is made on clinical suspicion and treatment has begun, specialized laboratory testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of RMSF.
 
 
  
 
 
               
 
Laboratory Confirmation
               
R. rickettsii infects the endothelial cells that line blood vessels, and does not circulate in large numbers in the blood unless the patient has progressed to a very severe phase of infection. For this reason, blood specimens (whole blood, serum) are not always useful for detection of the organism through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture. If the patient has a rash, PCR or immunohistochemical (IHC) staining can be performed on a skin biopsy taken from the rash site. This test can often deliver a rapid result. These tests have good sensitivity (70%) when applied to tissue specimens collected during the acute phase of illness and before antibiotic treatment has been started, but a negative result should not be used to guide treatment decisions. PCR, culture, and IHC can also be applied to autopsy specimens (liver, spleen, kidney, etc) collected after a patient dies. Culture of R. rickettsii is only available at specialized laboratories; routine hospital blood cultures cannot detect R. rickettsii.
               
During RMSF infection, a patient’s immune system develops antibodies to R. rickettsii, with detectable antibody titers usually observed by 7-10 days after illness onset. It is important to note that antibodies are not detectable in the first week of illness in 85% of patients, and a negative test during this time does not rule out RMSF as a cause of illness.
               
The gold standard serologic test for diagnosis of RMSF is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with R. rickettsii antigen, performed on two paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titers. The first sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible, preferably in the first week of symptoms, and the second sample should be taken 2 to 4 weeks later. In most RMSF cases, the first IgG IFA titer is typically low or negative, and the second typically shows a significant (fourfold) increase in IgG antibody levels. IgM antibodies usually rise at the same time as IgG near the end of the first week of illness and remain elevated for months or even years. Also, IgM antibodies are less specific than IgG antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive. For these reasons, physicians requesting IgM serologic titers should also request a concurrent IgG titer.
               
Both IgM and IgG levels may remain elevated for months or longer after the disease has resolved, or may be detected in persons who were previously exposed to antigenically related organisms. Up to 10% of currently healthy people in some areas may have elevated antibody titers due to past exposure to R. rickettsii or similar organisms. Therefore, if only one sample is tested it can be difficult to interpret, whereas two paired samples taken weeks apart demonstrating a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titer provide the best evidence for a correct diagnosis of RMSF. For more in-depth information about testing, please visit http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm
               
 
Treatment
               
Doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages and should be initiated immediately whenever RMSF is suspected. 
               
Use of antibiotics other than doxycycline is associated with a higher risk of fatal outcome. Treatment is most effective at preventing death if doxycycline is started in the first 5 days of symptoms. Therefore, treatment must be based on clinical suspicion alone and should always begin before laboratory results return or symptoms of severe disease, such as petechiae, develop.
               
If the patient is treated within the first 5 days of the disease, fever generally subsides within 24-72 hours. In fact, failure to respond to doxycycline suggests that the patient’s condition might not be RMSF. Severely ill patients may require longer periods before their fever resolves, especially if they have experienced damage to multiple organ systems. Resistance to doxcycline or relapses in symptoms after the completion of the recommended course of treatment have not been documented.
               
Recommended Dosage
Doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages:
 
 - Adults: 100 mg every 12 hours
 - Children under 45 kg (100 lbs): 2.2 mg/kg body weight given twice a day
 
               
Patients should be treated for at least 3 days after the fever subsides and until there is evidence of clinical improvement. Standard duration of treatment is 7-14 days.
Treating Children
               
The use of doxycycline to treat suspected RMSF in children is standard practice recommended by both CDC and the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases. Use of antibiotics other than doxycycline increases the risk of patient death. Unlike older tetracyclines, the recommended dose and duration of medication needed to treat RMSF has not been shown to cause staining of permanent teeth, even when five courses are given before the age of eight. Healthcare providers should use doxycycline as the first-line treatment for suspected Rocky Mountain spotted fever in patients of all ages.
Other Treatments
               
In cases of life threatening allergies to doxycycline and in some pregnant patients for whom the clinical course of RMSF appears mild, chloramphenicol may be considered as an alternative antibiotic. Oral forumulations of chloramphenicol are not available in the United States, and use of this drug carries the potential for other adverse risks, such as aplastic anemia and Grey baby syndrome. Furthermore, the risk for fatal outcome is elevated in patients who are treated with chloramphenicol compared to those treated with doxycycline. Other antibiotics, including broad spectrum antibiotics are not effective against R. rickettsii, and the use of sulfa drugs may worsen infection.
Prophylaxis (Preventive Treatment)
               
Antibiotic treatment following a tick bite is not recommended as a means to prevent RMSF. There is no evidence this practice is effective, and may simply delay onset of disease. Instead, persons who experience a tick bite should be alert for symptoms suggestive of tickborne illness and consult a physician if fever, rash, or other symptoms of concern develop.

Other Considerations
               
The clinical presentation for RMSF can also resemble other tickborne diseases, such as ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis. Similar to RMSF, these infections respond well to treatment with doxycycline. Healthcare providers should order diagnostic tests for additional agents if the clinical history and geographic association warrant. For more in-depth about other similar tickborne diseases, please visit http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm","Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) is a tick-borne illness caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii.

8,What is (are) Parasites - Trichuriasis (also known as Whipworm Infection) ?,Whipworm (Trichuris trichiura) is an intestinal parasite of humans. The larvae and adult worms live in the intestine of humans and can cause intestinal disease. The name is derived from the worm’s distinctive whip-like shape.,"Trichuriasis, also known as Whipworm Infection, is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode worm Trichuris trichiura. It's a common intestinal infection worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.

Here's a brief overview:

* Trichuriasis is typically acquired by ingesting contaminated food, water, or feces, usually through poor hygiene or inadequate sanitation.
* The parasite enters the body and attaches to the lining of the large intestine, where it feeds on the host's nutrients.
* Symptoms can range from mild to severe and may include:
+ Abdominal pain or discomfort
+ Diarrhea or constipation
+ Weight loss
+ Fatigue
+ Blood in the stool (in severe cases)
* If left untreated, Trichuriasis can lead to complications such as malnutrition, anemia, and impaired growth and development in children.
* Diagnosis is typically made through stool examination, which detects the parasite's eggs or larvae.
* Treatment usually involves antihelmintic medications, such as mebendazole or albendazole, which can effectively eliminate the parasite.

No vaccine is available.
   
The best way to prevent schistosomiasis is to take the following steps if you are visiting or live in an area where schistosomiasis is transmitted:
   
     - Avoid swimming or wading in freshwater when you are in countries in which schistosomiasis occurs. Swimming in the ocean and in chlorinated swimming pools is safe.
     - Drink safe water. Although schistosomiasis is not transmitted by swallowing contaminated water, if your mouth or lips come in contact with water containing the parasites, you could become infected. Because water coming directly from canals, lakes, rivers, streams, or springs may be contaminated with a variety of infectious organisms, you should either bring your water to a rolling boil for 1 minute or filter water before drinking it. Bring your water to a rolling boil for at least 1 minute will kill any harmful parasites, bacteria, or viruses present. Iodine treatment alone WILL NOT GUARANTEE that water is safe and free of all parasites.
     - Water used for bathing should be brought to a rolling boil for 1 minute to kill any cercariae, and then cooled before bathing to avoid scalding. Water held in a storage tank for at least 1 - 2 days should be safe for bathing.
     - Vigorous towel drying after an accidental, very brief water exposure may help to prevent the Schistosoma parasite from penetrating the skin. However, do not rely on vigorous towel drying alone to prevent schistosomiasis.
   
   
Those who have had contact with potentially contaminated water overseas should see their health care provider after returning from travel to discuss testing.

   Control
  
In countries where schistosomiasis causes significant disease, control efforts usually focus on:
  
    - reducing the number of infections in people and/or
    - eliminating the snails that are required to maintain the parasite’s life cycle.
  
  
For all species that cause schistosomiasis, improved sanitation could reduce or eliminate transmission of this disease. In some areas with lower transmission levels, elimination of schistosomiasis is considered a ""winnable battle"" by public health officials.
  
Control measures can include mass drug treatment of entire communities and targeted treatment of school-age children. Some of the problems with control of schistosomiasis include:
  
    - Chemicals used to eliminate snails in freshwater sources may harm other species of animals in the water and, if treatment is not sustained, the snails may return to those sites afterwards.
    - For certain species of the parasite, such as S. japonicum, animals such as cows or water buffalo can also be infected. Runoff from pastures (if the cows are infected) can contaminate freshwater sources.","Schistosomiasis, also known as snail fever, is a parasitic disease caused by the Schistosoma parasite. To prevent it, take the following measures:

1. Avoid swimming or wading in contaminated water: Schistosomiasis is typically spread through contact with contaminated water, so it's essential to avoid swimming or wading in areas where the parasite is present.
2. Use proper sanitation and hygiene: Regularly clean and disinfect areas where water is used, such as bathrooms and showers, to reduce the risk of transmission.
3. Wear protective clothing: When swimming or wading in areas where the parasite is present, wear protective clothing such as long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and closed-toe shoes.
4. Use insecticides: Insecticides can help reduce the number of snails that carry the parasite, making it less likely for humans to be infected.
5. Practice good hygiene: Wash your hands regularly, especially after using the bathroom or before eating, to reduce the risk of transmission.

The acute symptoms caused by infection with Coxiella burnetii usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected withC. burnetii do not show symptoms.
 
The following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with acute Q fever. However, it is important to note that the combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person.
 
  - high fevers (up to 104-105°F) 
  - severe headache 
  - general malaise 
  - myalgia 
  - chills and/or sweats 
  - non-productive cough 
  - nausea 
  - vomiting 
  - diarrhea 
  - abdominal pain 
  - chest pain 
 
 
Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may experience serious illness with complications that may include pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), myocarditis (inflammation of the heart tissue) and central nervous system complications. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage. The estimated case fatality rate (i.e. the proportion of persons who die as a result of their infection) is low,  at < 2% of hospitalized patients. Treatment with the correct antibiotic may shorten the course of illness for acute Q fever. 
 
Chronic Q fever is a severe disease occurring in <5% of acutely infected patients. It may present soon (within 6 weeks) after an acute infection, or may manifest years later.  The three groups at highest risk for chronic Q fever are pregnant women, immunosuppressed persons and patients with a pre-existing heart valve defects. Endocarditis is the major form of chronic disease, comprising 60-70% of all reported cases. The estimated case fatality rate in untreated patients with endocarditis is 25-60%. Patients with endocarditis require early diagnosis and long-term antibiotic treatment (at least 18 months) for a successful outcome.   Other forms of chronic Q fever include aortic aneurysms and infections of the bone, liver or reproductive organs, such as the testes in males.
 
Coxiella burnetii has the ability to persist for long periods of time in the host after infection. Although the majority of people with acute Q fever recover completely, a post-Q fever fatigue syndrome has been reported to occur in 10-25% of some acute patients. This syndrome is characterized by constant or recurring fatigue, night sweats, severe headaches, photophobia (eye sensitivity to light), pain in muscles and joints, mood changes, and difficulty sleeping. 
 
 
 Physician Diagnosis
 
There are several aspects of Q fever that make it challenging for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat.  The symptoms vary from patient to patient and can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases.  Treatment is more likely to be effective if started in the first three days of symptoms. Diagnostic tests based on the detection of antibodies will frequently appear negative in the first 7-10 days of illness.  For this reason, healthcare providers must use their judgment to treat patients based on clinical suspicion alone. Healthcare providers may find important information in the patient’s history and physical examination that may aid clinical diagnosis. Information such as recent travel to rural or agricultural communities where infected livestock may be present, or employment in high risk occupations such as veterinarians or farmers can be helpful in making the diagnosis.  Chronic Q fever is a risk for anyone with a history of acute Q fever illness, particularly those persons with valvular disease, blood vessel abnormalities, immunosuppressed persons, and women who were pregnant when they became infected. 
 
The healthcare provider should also look at routine blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count or a chemistry panel. Clues such as a prolonged fever with low platelet count, normal leukocyte count, and elevated liver enzymes are suggestive of acute Q fever infection, but may not be present in all patients.  After a suspect diagnosis is made based on clinical suspicion and treatment has begun, specialized laboratory testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of Q fever.
 
Suspect diagnosis of Q fever is made based on signs and symptoms and a high index of clinical suspicion.  Diagnosis can later be confirmed using specialized confirmatory laboratory tests. Treatment should never be delayed pending the receipt of laboratory test results, or be withheld on the basis of an initial negative laboratory result.
 
 
 
 
 Laboratory Confirmation
 
During the acute phase of illness, a sample of whole blood can be tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to determine if a patient has Q fever. This method is most sensitive in the first week of illness, and rapidly decreases in sensitivity following the administration of appropriate antibiotics. PCR or immunohistochemistry of biopsy specimens has also been used to diagnose Q fever. These tests may be appropriate for endocarditis patients undergoing valve replacement surgery or patients with hepatitis. Although a positive PCR result is helpful, a negative result does not rule out the diagnosis, and treatment should not be withheld due to a negative result. Culture isolation of C. burnetii is only available at specialized laboratories; routine hospital blood cultures cannot detect the organism. 
 
When a person develops Q fever, their immune system produces antibodies to C. burnetii, with detectable antibody titers usually observed by 7-10 days after illness onset.  It is important to note that a negative test during the first week of illness does not rule out Q fever as a cause of illness. There are two distinct antigenic phases to which humans develop antibody responses. In acute infection, an antibody response to C. burnetii Phase II antigen is predominant and is higher than Phase I antibody response; the reverse is true in chronic infection which is associated with a rising Phase I IgG titer (according to current U.S. case definitions >1:800) that is often much higher than Phase II IgG.  The gold standard serologic test for diagnosis of acute Q fever is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using C. burnetii antigen, performed on paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titers. The first sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible, preferably in the first week of symptoms, and the second sample should be taken 2 to 4 weeks later. In most cases of Q fever, the first IgG IFA titer is typically low, or “negative,” and the second typically shows a significant (four-fold) increase in IgG antibody levels. IgM antibodies usually rise at the same time as IgG near the end of the first week of illness and remain elevated for months or longer.  Also, IgM antibodies are less specific than IgG antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive.  For these reasons, physicians should request both Phase I and Phase II IgG and IgM serologic titers for diagnostic confirmation of acute and chronic Q fever.  Antibodies to C. burnetii may remain elevated for months or longer after the disease has resolved, or may be detected in persons who were previously exposed to antigenically related organisms.  Approximately 3% of currently healthy people in the U.S. general population and up to 20% of people in high-risk professions (veterinarians, ranchers, etc.) have elevated antibody titers due to past exposure to C. burnetii. Therefore, if only one sample is tested it can be difficult to interpret the findings. 
 
Paired samples taken 2-3 weeks apart demonstrating a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titer provides the best evidence for a correct diagnosis of acute Q fever. Diagnosis of chronic Q fever is confirmed by elevated Phase I IgG antibody (according to current U.S. case definitions >1:800 and higher than Phase II IgG) and an identifiable persistent focus of infection (e.g. endocarditis).  Elevated Phase I titers alone do not confirm a chronic Q fever diagnosis and would not warrant treatment in a clinically normal patient. Because chronic Q fever involves lengthy persistence of the organism in the body, the antibody levels are often quite high and you will not see a rising titer between paired serum specimens.

 Treatment
 
Doxycycline is the first line treatment for all adults, and for children with severe illness. Treatment should be initiated immediately whenever Q fever is suspected.
 
Use of antibiotics other than doxycycline or other tetracyclines is associated with a higher risk of severe illness. Doxycycline is most effective at preventing severe complications from developing if it is started early in the course of disease. Therefore, treatment must be based on clinical suspicion alone and should always begin before laboratory results return.
 
If the patient is treated within the first 3 days of the disease, fever generally subsides within 72 hours.  In fact, failure to respond to doxycycline suggests that the patient’s condition might not be due to Q fever. Severely ill patients may require longer periods before their fever resolves. Resistance to doxcycline has not been documented. 
 
There is no role for prophylactic antimicrobial agents in preventing Q fever after a known exposure and prior to symptom onset; attempts at prophylaxis will likely extend the incubation period by several days but will not prevent infection from occurring. 
 
Recommended Dosage for Acute Q fever
 Doxycycline is the first line treatment for children with severe illness of all ages and adults:
 
  - Adults: 100 mg every 12 hours 
  - Children under 45 kg (100 lbs): 2.2 mg/kg body weight given twice a day 
 
 
Patients should be treated for at least 3 days after the fever subsides and until there is evidence of clinical improvement. Standard duration of treatment is 2-3 weeks. 
 
Recommended Dosage for Chronic Q fever
 
  - Adults: Doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg every 8 hours.
 
 
Standard duration of treatment is 18 months.
 
 
 Treating children
 
The use of doxycycline is recommended to treat Q fever in children of all ages who are hospitalized or are severely ill. Unlike older generations of tetracyclines, doxycycline has not been shown to cause staining of permanent teeth, and most experts consider the benefit of doxycycline in treating Q fever in children younger than 8 years of age with severe illness or who are hospitalized greater than the potential risk of dental staining.  Children with mild illness who are less than 8 years of age may be treated with co-trimoxazole, but therapy should be switched to doxycycline if their course of illness worsens.
 
 
 Other Treatments
 
In cases of life threatening allergies to doxycycline and in pregnant patients, physicians may need to consider alternate antibiotics. Treatment of pregnant women diagnosed with acute Q fever with once daily co-trimoxazole throughout pregnancy has been shown to significantly decrease the risk of adverse consequences for the fetus.","Q Fever is a bacterial infection caused by Coxiella burnetii.

It's a zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans. The bacteria are typically found in the milk and urine of infected animals, such as sheep, goats, and cattle.

The name ""Q Fever"" comes from the fact that the disease was first identified in the 1930s, and the letter ""Q"" was used to represent the unknown cause of the illness. The disease is also sometimes referred to as ""Coxiella burnetii infection"" or ""Cattle fever.""

Q Fever can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, headache, and fatigue. In severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia, endocarditis (inflammation of the heart valves), and other complications. If left untreated, Q Fever can have serious consequences, including miscarriage, stillbirth, and birth defects.

26,How to prevent Q Fever ?,"In the United States, Q fever outbreaks have resulted mainly from occupational exposure involving veterinarians, meat processing plant workers, sheep and dairy workers, livestock farmers, and researchers at facilities housing sheep. Prevention and control efforts should be directed primarily toward these groups and environments.
 
The following measures should be used in the prevention and control of Q fever:
 
  - Educate the public on sources of infection. 
  - Appropriately dispose of placenta, birth products, fetal membranes, and aborted fetuses at facilities housing sheep and goats. 
  - Restrict access to barns and laboratories used in housing potentially infected animals.  
  - Use appropriate procedures for bagging, autoclaving, and washing of laboratory clothing. 
  - Vaccinate (where possible) individuals engaged in research with pregnant sheep or live C. burnetii. 
  - Quarantine imported animals. 
  - Ensure that holding facilities for sheep should be located away from populated areas. Animals should be routinely tested for antibodies to C. burnetii, and measures should be implemented to prevent airflow to other occupied areas. 
  - Counsel persons at highest risk for developing chronic Q fever, especially persons with pre-existing cardiac valvular disease or individuals with vascular grafts. 
 
 
A vaccine for Q fever has been developed and has successfully protected humans in occupational settings in Australia. However, this vaccine is not commercially available in the United States. Persons wishing to be vaccinated should first have a skin test to determine a history of previous exposure. Individuals who have previously been exposed to C. burnetii should not receive the vaccine because severe reactions, localized to the area of the injected vaccine, may occur. A vaccine for use in animals has also been developed, but it is not available in the United States.
 Significance for Bioterrorism
 
Coxiella burnetii is a highly infectious agent that is rather resistant to heat and drying. It can become airborne and inhaled by humans. A single C. burnetii organism may cause disease in a susceptible person. This agent has a past history of being developed for use in biological warfare and is considered a potential terrorist threat.","Q Fever is a bacterial infection caused by Coxiella burnetii, which can be spread through contact with contaminated animals, contaminated water, or airborne transmission. To prevent the spread of Q Fever, take the following steps:

1. Practice good hygiene: Wash your hands frequently, especially after contact with animals, their waste, or contaminated water.
2. Avoid contact with infected animals: If you're working with animals, especially sheep, goats, or cattle, take precautions to avoid contact with their urine, feces, or birth products.
3. Wear protective gear: Wear gloves, masks, and protective clothing when handling animals or their products to prevent skin and respiratory contact.
4. Avoid drinking untreated water: Avoid drinking untreated water, especially in areas where Q Fever is common.
5. Avoid sharing food and drinks: Avoid sharing food and drinks with others, especially if you've been in contact with infected animals or contaminated water.
6. Get vaccinated: If you're working with animals or living in an area where Q Fever is common, consider getting vaccinated against Q Fever.
7. Report suspected cases: If you suspect someone has Q Fever, report it to your healthcare provider or local health authorities.
8. Maintain a clean environment: Regularly clean and disinfect surfaces, equipment, and clothing to prevent the spread of the bacteria.
9. Avoid sharing personal items: Avoid sharing personal items, such as towels, clothing, or bedding, with others to prevent the spread of the bacteria.
10. Practice good ventilation: If you're working in an area where Q Fever is present, ensure good ventilation to reduce the risk of airborne transmission.

27,What are the symptoms of Typhoid Fever ?,"Persons with typhoid fever usually have a sustained fever as high as 103° to 104° F (39° to 40° C). They may also feel weak, or have stomach pains, headache, or loss of appetite. In some cases, patients have a rash of flat, rose-colored spots. The only way to know for sure if an illness is typhoid fever is to have samples of stool or blood tested for the presence of Salmonella Typhi.

Typhoid fever’s danger doesn’t end when symptoms disappear:

Even if your symptoms seem to go away, you may still be carrying Salmonella Typhi. If so, the illness could return, or you could pass the disease to other people. In fact, if you work at a job where you handle food or care for small children, you may be barred legally from going back to work until a doctor has determined that you no longer carry any typhoid bacteria.
               
If you are being treated for typhoid fever, it is important to do the following:
               
Keep taking the prescribed antibiotics for as long as the doctor has asked you to take them.
               
Wash your hands carefully with soap and water after using the bathroom, and do not prepare or serve food for other people. This will lower the chance that you will pass the infection on to someone else.
               
Have your doctor perform a series of stool cultures to ensure that no Salmonella Typhi bacteria remain in your body.","Typhoid fever, caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi, typically presents with a combination of the following characteristic signs and symptoms:

1. Fever: A high-grade fever, often accompanied by chills, is a hallmark of typhoid fever. The fever usually begins abruptly and can last for several weeks.
2. Headache: A severe headache, often described as a dull, throbbing pain, is a common symptom.
3. Abdominal pain: Mild to severe abdominal pain, often accompanied by tenderness, is a common feature.
4. Diarrhea or constipation: Patients may experience diarrhea, constipation, or alternating episodes of both.
5. Nausea and vomiting: Nausea and vomiting are common, especially in the early stages of the illness.
6. Fatigue: Patients often feel extremely fatigued and may experience a general feeling of malaise.
7. Rash: A rose-colored rash, known as the ""rose spots,"" may appear on the trunk, arms, and legs. This rash is a classic sign of typhoid fever, but it's not always present.
8. Enlarged spleen: In some cases, the spleen may become enlarged, which can be detected through physical examination.
9. Lymphadenopathy: Enlarged lymph nodes, particularly in the neck and axillary regions, may be present.
10. Hepatosplenomegaly: Enlargement of the liver and spleen can occur in severe cases.

Cystic echinococcosis (CE) disease results from being infected with the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus, a tiny tapeworm (~2-7 millimeters in length) found in dogs (definitive host), sheep, cattle, goats, foxes, and pigs, amongst others (intermediate hosts). Most infections in humans are asymptomatic, but CE, also known as hydatid disease, causes slowly enlarging masses, most commonly in the liver and the lungs. Treatment can involve both medication and surgery.

Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) disease results from being infected with the larval stage of Echinococcus multilocularis, a tiny tapeworm (~1-4 millimeters in length) found in foxes, coyotes, dogs, and cats (definitive hosts). Although human cases are rare, infection in humans causes parasitic tumors to form in the liver, and, less commonly, the lungs, brain, and other organs. If left untreated, infection with AE can be fatal.
   
More on: Alveolar Echinococcosis (AE) FAQs","Echinococcosis is a parasitic infection caused by the larvae of tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus. The most common species responsible for this infection are Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis.

Echinococcosis is typically acquired by ingesting contaminated food or water, or through contact with an infected animal's feces. The larvae then migrate to various parts of the body, such as the liver, lungs, or brain, where they form cysts.

Symptoms of echinococcosis can vary depending on the location and size of the cysts, but may include abdominal pain, coughing, chest pain, or seizures. If left untreated, echinococcosis can lead to serious complications, such as organ damage or even death.

Treatment for echinococcosis usually involves surgical removal of the cysts, followed by medication to kill any remaining parasites.",No harm,Low,No harm,Low,No harm,Low
33,Who is at risk for Parasites - Echinococcosis? ?,"Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is caused by infection with the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus. CE is found in Africa, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Central and South America, and in rare cases, North America. The parasite is transmitted to dogs when they ingest the organs of other animals that contain hydatid cysts. The cysts develop into adult tapeworms in the dog. Infected dogs shed tapeworm eggs in their feces which contaminate the ground. Sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs ingest tapeworm eggs in the contaminated ground; once ingested, the eggs hatch and develop into cysts in the internal organs. The most common mode of transmission to humans is by the accidental consumption of soil, water, or food that has been contaminated by the fecal matter of an infected dog. Echinococcus eggs that have been deposited in soil can stay viable for up to a year. The disease is most commonly found in people involved in raising sheep, as a result of the sheep's role as an intermediate host of the parasite and the presence of working dogs that are allowed to eat the offal of infected sheep.
   
Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is caused by infection with the larval stage of Echinococcus multilocularis. AE is found across the globe and is especially prevalent in the northern latitudes of Europe, Asia, and North America. The adult tapeworm is normally found in foxes, coyotes, and dogs. Infection with the larval stages is transmitted to people through ingestion of food or water contaminated with tapeworm eggs.","Echinococcosis is a parasitic infection caused by the Echinococcus granulosus parasite, which is typically found in dogs and other canines. The risk of infection is higher in certain demographics, including:

1. People who live in or travel to areas where the parasite is common, such as:
* Rural or agricultural areas in the Mediterranean, Africa, Asia, and South America
* Regions with poor sanitation and hygiene
2. Individuals who have close contact with dogs, such as:
* Dog handlers, breeders, or owners
* People who work with dogs, such as veterinarians, animal control officers, or dog trainers
3. Children and young adults, as they are more likely to be infected through accidental ingestion of contaminated feces or urine
4. People with compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or taking immunosuppressive therapy
5. Travelers who engage in outdoor activities, such as hiking, camping, or hunting, in areas where the parasite is present

It's essential to note that anyone can get infected with Echinococcosis, regardless of age, sex, or occupation. However, those who fall into the above demographics are at a higher risk. If you're concerned about your risk or have symptoms, consult a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and guidance.",No harm,Low,No harm,Low,Moderate or mild harm,Low
34,How to diagnose Parasites - Echinococcosis ?,"The presence of a cyst-like mass in a person with a history of exposure to sheepdogs in an area where E. granulosus is endemic suggests a diagnosis of cystic echinococcosis. Imaging techniques, such as CT scans, ultrasonography, and MRIs, are used to detect cysts. After a cyst has been detected, serologic tests may be used to confirm the diagnosis.
   
Alveolar echinococcosis is typically found in older people. Imaging techniques such as CT scans are used to visually confirm the parasitic vesicles and cyst-like structures and serologic tests can confirm the parasitic infection.","Echinococcosis is a parasitic infection caused by the larvae of tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus. The diagnostic techniques used to identify Echinococcosis include:

1. Imaging tests: Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are used to detect cysts and lesions in the liver, lungs, and other organs.
2. Serological tests: Blood tests, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot, are used to detect antibodies against Echinococcus antigens in the blood.
3. Cyst fluid analysis: Analysis of fluid aspirated from the cysts can help identify the parasite and determine the severity of the infection.
4. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing: PCR testing can detect the presence of Echinococcus DNA in blood, urine, or cyst fluid.
5. Laparoscopy or thoracoscopy: These minimally invasive procedures can be used to visualize the cysts and collect tissue samples for further examination.
6. Histopathology: Examination of tissue samples under a microscope can help confirm the diagnosis of Echinococcosis.
7. Eosinophilia: Elevated levels of eosinophils in the blood can be a sign of Echinococcosis.

It's important to note that a combination of these diagnostic techniques may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of Echinococcosis.",No harm,Low,No harm,Low,Death or severe harm,Medium
35,What are the treatments for Parasites - Echinococcosis ?,"In the past, surgery was the only treatment for cystic echinococcal cysts. Chemotherapy, cyst puncture, and PAIR (percutaneous aspiration, injection of chemicals and reaspiration) have been used to replace surgery as effective treatments for cystic echinococcosis. However, surgery remains the most effective treatment to remove the cyst and can lead to a complete cure. Some cysts are not causing any symptoms and are inactive; those cysts often go away without any treatment.
   
The treatment of alveolar echinococcosis is more difficult than cystic echinococcosis and usually requires radical surgery, long-term chemotherapy, or both.
   
More on: Resources for Health Professionals: Treatment","Echinococcosis is a serious parasitic infection caused by the Echinococcus granulosus parasite. The best course of treatment typically involves a combination of medical therapy and surgical intervention. Here's a general overview:

1. Medical therapy:
* Albendazole (Albenza) is the primary medication used to treat echinococcosis. It's usually administered orally for 28 days, and may be repeated if necessary.
* Mebendazole (Vermox) is another antiparasitic medication that may be used in combination with albendazole.
2. Surgical intervention:
* Surgical removal of the hydatid cyst (the cyst formed by the parasite) is often necessary, especially if the cyst is large, ruptured, or causing symptoms.
* The surgical procedure, called a laparoscopic or open cystectomy, aims to remove the cyst and any remaining parasite fragments.
3. Post-operative care:
* Patients may receive additional medication to prevent recurrence, such as albendazole or mebendazole, for several months after surgery.
* Regular follow-up appointments with a healthcare provider are crucial to monitor the patient's progress and detect any potential recurrences.

It's essential to note that treatment should only be initiated under the guidance of a healthcare provider, as echinococcosis can be a complex and potentially life-threatening condition. Additionally, patients with compromised immune systems or those who are pregnant or breastfeeding may require special considerations.

In some cases, echinococcosis may not respond to medical therapy alone, and surgical intervention may be necessary. In these situations, a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including surgeons, infectious disease specialists, and radiologists, may be involved in the patient's care.

If you or someone you know has been infected with Echinococcosis parasites, it's crucial to seek medical attention promptly to receive proper diagnosis and treatment.",No harm,Low,Moderate or mild harm,Low,Moderate or mild harm,Medium
36,How to prevent Parasites - Echinococcosis ?,"Cystic echinococcosis is controlled by preventing transmission of the parasite. Prevention measures include limiting the areas where dogs are allowed and preventing animals from consuming meat infected with cysts.
   
     - Prevent dogs from feeding on the carcasses of infected sheep.
     - Control stray dog populations.
     - Restrict home slaughter of sheep and other livestock.
     - Do not consume any food or water that may have been contaminated by fecal matter from dogs.

39,What is (are) Parasites - Babesiosis ?,"Babesiosis is caused by microscopic parasites that infect red blood cells. Most human cases of Babesia infection in the United States are caused by the parasite Babesia microti. Occasional cases caused by other species (types) of Babesia have been detected. Babesia microti is spread in nature by Ixodes scapularis ticks (also called blacklegged ticks or deer ticks). Tickborne transmission is most common in particular regions and seasons: it mainly occurs in parts of the Northeast and upper Midwest; and it usually peaks during the warm months. Babesia infection can range in severity from asymptomatic to life threatening. The infection is both treatable and preventable.
    Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
   
    Podcasts","Babesiosis is a tick-borne disease caused by the parasite Babesia microti. It's a type of apicomplexan parasite that infects red blood cells, causing symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, and fatigue.

The connection between parasites and Babesiosis is that Babesia microti is a protozoan parasite that is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis). The parasite multiplies within the tick's salivary glands before being transmitted to a human host.

Once inside the human body, the parasite infects red blood cells, causing them to rupture and leading to anemia, jaundice, and other complications. If left untreated, Babesiosis can be severe and even life-threatening.

It's essential for individuals who spend time outdoors, especially in areas where ticks are common, to take preventive measures such as using insect repellents, wearing protective clothing, and conducting regular tick checks. If you suspect you've been bitten by a tick or are experiencing symptoms of Babesiosis, it's crucial to seek medical attention promptly.",No harm,Low,No harm,Low,No harm,Low
40,Who is at risk for Parasites - Babesiosis? ?,"People can get infected with Babesia parasites in several ways:
   
     - The main way is through the bite of an infected tick—during outdoor activities in areas where babesiosis is found (see below).
     - A less common way is by getting a transfusion from a blood donor who has a Babesia infection but does not have any symptoms. (No tests have been licensed yet for screening blood donors for Babesia.)
     - Rare cases of congenital transmission—from an infected mother to her baby (during pregnancy or delivery)—have been reported.
   
   
Babesia parasites are not transmitted from person-to-person like the flu or the common cold.
   
Many different species (types) of Babesia parasites have been found in animals, only a few of which have been found in people. Babesia microti—which usually infects white-footed mice and other small mammals—is the main species that has been found in people in the United States. Occasional (sporadic) cases of babesiosis caused by other Babesia species have been detected.
   
    
   
   
Babesia microti is transmitted in nature by Ixodes scapularis ticks (also called blacklegged ticks or deer ticks).
   
     - Tickborne transmission primarily occurs in the Northeast and upper Midwest, especially in parts of New England, New York state, New Jersey, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.
     - The parasite typically is spread by the young nymph stage of the tick, which is most apt to be found (seeking or ""questing"" for a blood meal) during warm months (spring and summer), in areas with woods, brush, or grass.
     - Infected people might not recall a tick bite because I. scapularis nymphs are very small (about the size of a poppy seed).","Babesiosis is a tick-borne parasitic infection that can affect anyone, but certain individuals are more vulnerable to infection. The most vulnerable groups include:

1. Asplenic individuals: People who have had their spleen removed (splenectomy) or have a condition that affects the spleen's function are at higher risk of developing severe and potentially life-threatening babesiosis.
2. Immunocompromised individuals: Those with weakened immune systems, such as people with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or taking immunosuppressive medications, are more susceptible to severe babesiosis.
3. Older adults: Older adults may be more prone to severe babesiosis due to age-related decline in immune function.
4. Young children: Infants and young children are more susceptible to babesiosis, especially if they are not vaccinated against the disease.
5. People with certain medical conditions: Individuals with conditions such as kidney disease, liver disease, or heart disease may be more vulnerable to babesiosis.

It's essential for these individuals to take preventive measures, such as using insect repellents, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding tick-infested areas.

More on: Resources for Health Professionals: Diagnosis","Babesiosis is a parasitic infection caused by the protozoan parasite Babesia microti. The diagnostic tests used to detect Babesiosis parasites typically include:

1. Complete Blood Count (CBC): A CBC is often the first test ordered to evaluate for anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, which are common manifestations of Babesiosis.
2. Blood Smear Examination: A blood smear examination is a microscopic examination of a thin film of blood, which can reveal the presence of Babesia parasites in the red blood cells.
3. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) Testing: PCR testing is a molecular diagnostic test that detects the presence of Babesia DNA in the blood.
4. ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) Testing: ELISA testing is an antibody-based test that detects the presence of antibodies against Babesia in the blood.
5. Indirect Fluorescent Antibody (IFA) Testing: IFA testing is another antibody-based test that detects the presence of antibodies against Babesia in the blood.
6. Serology Testing: Serology testing involves testing for the presence of antibodies against Babesia in the blood, which can indicate past or current infection.
7. PCR-based tests, such as the Babesia PCR assay, are often used to confirm the diagnosis and monitor treatment response.

The disease can be severe and even life-threatening, especially in people with compromised immune systems.

The treatment of babesiosis typically involves a combination of antibiotics and antiparasitic medications. The goal of treatment is to eliminate the parasite from the body and prevent complications.

The standard treatment for babesiosis typically includes:

1. Antibiotics: Azithromycin (Z-Pak) and atovaquone (Mepron) are commonly used antibiotics to treat babesiosis. These medications help to eliminate the parasite from the body.
2. Antiparasitic medications: Clindamycin (Cleocin) and doxycycline (Vibramycin) are often used in combination with antibiotics to treat babesiosis.
3. Supportive care: Patients with babesiosis may require supportive care, such as fluids, electrolyte replacement, and blood transfusions, to manage symptoms and prevent complications.

In severe cases of babesiosis, hospitalization may be necessary to provide close monitoring and treatment. In some cases, exchange transfusions may be necessary to remove infected red blood cells from the body.

It's important to note that prompt treatment is essential to prevent complications and improve outcomes. If you suspect you have been bitten by an infected tick or are experiencing symptoms of babesiosis, it's essential to seek medical attention immediately.

Prevention is also key. To reduce the risk of contracting babesiosis, take the following steps:

* Use insect repellent and wear protective clothing when outdoors in tick-prone areas.
* Conduct regular tick checks on yourself, children, and pets after spending time outdoors.
* Remove attached ticks promptly and correctly.
* Use permethrin-treated clothing and gear to repel ticks.
* Avoid areas with high grass and leaf litter, where ticks are more likely to be present.

43,How to prevent Parasites - Babesiosis ?,"Steps can be taken to reduce the risk for babesiosis and other tickborne infections. The use of prevention measures is especially important for people at increased risk for severe babesiosis (for example, people who do not have a spleen). Avoiding exposure to tick habitats is the best defense.
  
Babesia microti is spread by Ixodes scapularis ticks, which are mostly found in wooded, brushy, or grassy areas, in certain regions and seasons. No vaccine is available to protect people against babesiosis. However, people who live, work, or travel in tick-infested areas can take simple steps to help protect themselves against tick bites and tickborne infections.
  
   
  
  
During outdoor activities in tick habitats, take precautions to keep ticks off the skin.
  
    - Walk on cleared trails and stay in the center of the trail, to minimize contact with leaf litter, brush, and overgrown grasses, where ticks are most likely to be found.
    - Minimize the amount of exposed skin, by wearing socks, long pants, and a long-sleeved shirt. Tuck the pant legs into the socks, so ticks cannot crawl up the inside of the pants. Wear light-colored clothing, to make it easier to see and remove ticks before they attach to skin.
    - Apply repellents to skin and clothing. Follow the instructions on the product label.
    
      - Products that contain DEET (N,N-diethylmetatoluamide) can be directly applied to exposed skin and to clothing, to help keep ticks away (by repelling them). The product label includes details about how and where to apply the repellent, how often to reapply it, and how to use it safely on children.
      - Permethrin products can be applied to clothing/boots (not to skin), actually kill ticks that come in contact with the treated clothing, and usually stay effective through several washings.
    
  
  
   
  
  
After outdoor activities, conduct daily tick checks and promptly remove any ticks that are found. Thorough, daily tick checks are very important. The I. scapularis nymphs that typically spread B. microti are so small (about the size of a poppy seed) that they are easily overlooked. But they usually must stay attached to a person for more than 36-48 hours to be able to transmit the parasite.
  
    - Remove ticks from clothing and pets before going indoors.
    - Conduct a full-body exam for ticks. Use a hand-held or full-length mirror to view all parts of the body. Be sure to check behind the knees, between the legs (groin/thighs), between the toes, under the arms (armpits), around the waist, inside the belly button, the back of the neck, behind and in the ears, as well as in and around the scalp, hairline, and hair. Remember to check children and pets, too.
  
  
Remove ticks that are attached to the skin as soon as possible, preferably by using pointed (fine-tipped) tweezers. Grab the tick’s mouth parts close to the skin, and slowly pull the tick straight out (with steady outward pressure), until the tick lets go.
  
More on: Removing Ticks
  
More on: Ticks","Babesiosis is a tick-borne disease caused by the parasite Babesia microti. To avoid contracting Babesiosis, follow these steps:

1. **Use insect repellent**: Apply insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus to exposed skin and clothing when spending time outdoors, especially in areas where ticks are common.
2. **Wear protective clothing**: Wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and closed-toe shoes when outdoors to reduce skin exposure.
3. **Conduct regular tick checks**: After spending time outdoors, inspect your body thoroughly for ticks, paying attention to areas like the scalp, armpits, and groin.
4. **Remove attached ticks promptly**: If you find a tick attached to your skin, remove it carefully with fine-tipped tweezers, grasping the tick as close to the skin as possible. Clean the bite area with soap and water.
5. **Avoid areas with high tick density**: Steer clear of areas with high grass, leaf litter, or brush, as these environments tend to harbor ticks.
6. **Use tick-repellent clothing**: Wear clothing and gear treated with tick-repellent materials, such as permethrin.
7. **Avoid contact with wild animals**: Avoid contact with wild animals, especially those that may carry ticks, like deer and rodents.
8. **Get vaccinated**: If you live in an area where Babesiosis is common, consider getting vaccinated against the disease.
9. **Monitor your health**: If you've been bitten by a tick, monitor your health for symptoms like fever, chills, and flu-like illness, which can occur within 1-4 weeks after infection.
10. **Seek medical attention if symptoms occur**: If you experience symptoms, seek medical attention promptly, as early treatment can significantly improve outcomes.

44,What are the symptoms of Anaplasmosis ?,"Anaplasmosis is a disease caused by the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilium. This pathogen is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick. The black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) is the vector of A. phagocytophilum in the northeast and upper midwestern United States. The western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus) is the primary vector in Northern California. The first symptoms of anaplasmosis typically begin within 1-2 weeks after the bite of an infected tick. A tick bite is usually painless, and some patients who develop anaplasmosis do not remember being bitten. The following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with this disease. However, it is important to note that few people with the disease will develop all symptoms, and the number and combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person.
 
  - Fever
  - Headache
  - Muscle pain
  - Malaise
  - Chills
  - Nausea / Abdominal pain
  - Cough
  - Confusion
  - Rash (rare with anaplasmosis)
 
 
Anaplasmosis can be a serious illness that can be fatal if not treated correctly, even in previously healthy people.  Severe clinical presentations may include difficulty breathing, hemorrhage, renal failure or neurological problems. The estimated case fatality rate (i.e., the proportion of persons who die as a result of their infection) is less than 1%. Patients who are treated early may recover quickly on outpatient medication, while those who experience a more severe course may require intravenous antibiotics, prolonged hospitalization or intensive care.
 
 
 Rash
 
Rash is rarely reported in patients with anaplasmosis and the presence of a rash may signify that the patient has a coinfection with the pathogen that causes Lyme disease or another tickborne disease, such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever .
 
 
 Immune-compromised Individuals
 
The severity of anaplasmosis may depend in part on the immune status of the patient. Persons with compromised immunity caused by immunosuppressive therapies (e.g., corticosteroids, cancer chemotherapy, or longterm immunosuppressive therapy following organ transplant), HIV infection, or splenectomy appear to develop more severe disease, and case-fatality rates for these individuals are characteristically higher than case-fatality rates reported for the general population.
 
 
 Blood Transfusion and Organ Transplant Risks Associated with Anaplasma species
 
Because A. phagocytophilum infects the white blood cells and circulates in the blood stream, this pathogen may pose a risk to be transmitted through blood transfusions. Anaplasma phagocytophilum has been shown to survive for more than a week in refrigerated blood. Several cases of anaplasmosis have been reported associated with the transfusion of packed red blood cells donated from asymptomatic or acutely infected donors. Patients who develop anaplasmosis within a month of receiving a blood transfusion or solid organ transplant should be reported to state health officials for prompt investigation. Use of leukoreduced blood products may theoretically decrease the risk of transfusion-associated transmission of these pathogens.  However, the filtration process does not remove all leukocytes or bacteria not associated with leukocytes from leukoreduced blood. Therefore, while this process may reduce the risk of transmission, it does not eliminate it completely.
 
 
 Physician Diagnosis
 
There are several aspects of anaplasmosis that make it challenging for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat.  The symptoms vary from patient to patient and can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases.  Treatment is more likely to be effective if started early in the course of disease. Diagnostic tests based on the detection of antibodies will frequently appear negative in the first 7-10 days of illness.
 
For this reason, healthcare providers must use their judgment to treat patients based on clinical suspicion alone. Healthcare providers may find important information in the patient’s history and physical examination that may aid clinical diagnosis. Information such as recent tick bites, exposure to areas where ticks are likely to be found, or history of recent travel to areas where anaplasmosis is endemic can be helpful in making the diagnosis.  The healthcare provider should also look at routine blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count or a chemistry panel. Clues such as a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), low white blood cell count (leukopenia), or elevated liver enzyme levels are helpful predictors of anaplasmosis, but may not be present in all patients.   After a suspect diagnosis is made on clinical suspicion and treatment has begun, specialized laboratory testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of anaplasmosis.
  
  
   
  
 
 
 
 Laboratory Detection
 
During the acute phase of illness, a sample of whole blood can be tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to determine if a patient has anaplasmosis. This method is most sensitive in the first week of illness, and rapidly decreases in sensitivity following the administration of appropriate antibiotics. Although a positive PCR result is helpful, a negative result does not completely rule out the diagnosis, and treatment should not be with held due to a negative result.
 
During the first week of illness a microscopic examination of blood smears (known as a peripheral blood smear) may reveal morulae (microcolonies of anaplasma) in the cytoplasm of white blood cells in up to 20% of patients.  During A. phagocytophilum infection, morulae are most frequently observed in granulocytes. However, the observance of morulae in a particular cell type cannot conclusively identify the infecting species. Culture isolation of A. phagocytophilum is only available at specialized laboratories; routine hospital blood cultures cannot detect the organism.
 Figure 1: Morulae detected in a granulocyte on a peripheral blood smear, associated with A. phagocytophilum infection.
 
  
    
   
  
 
 
When a person develops anaplasmosis, their immune system produces antibodies to A. phagocytophilum, with detectable antibody titers usually observed by 7-10 days after illness onset.  It is important to note that a negative test during the first week of illness does not rule out anaplasmosis as a cause of illness. 
 
The gold standard serologic test for diagnosis of anaplasmosis is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using A. phagocytophilum antigen, performed on paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titers.  The first sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible, preferably in the first week of symptoms, and the second sample should be taken 2 to 4 weeks later. In most cases of anaplasmosis, the first IgG IFA titer is typically low, or “negative,” and the second typically shows a significant (four-fold) increase in IgG antibody levels. IgM antibodies usually rise at the same time as IgG near the end of the first week of illness and remain elevated for months or longer.  Also, IgM antibodies are less specific than IgG antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive.  For these reasons, physicians requesting IgM serologic titers should also request a concurrent IgG titer.
 
Serologic tests based on enzyme immunoassay (EIA) technology are available from some commercial laboratories. However, EIA tests are qualitative rather than quantitative, meaning they only provide a positive/negative result, and are less useful to measure changes in antibody titers between paired specimens. Furthermore, some EIA assays rely on the evaluation of IgM antibody alone, which may have a higher frequency of false positive results.
 
Antibodies to A. phagocytophilum may remain elevated for months or longer after the disease has resolved, or may be detected in persons who were previously exposed to antigenically related organisms.  Between 5-10% of currently healthy people in some areas may have elevated antibody titers due to past exposure to A. phagocytophilum or similar organisms. Therefore, if only one sample is tested it can be difficult to interpret, while paired samples taken weeks apart demonstrating a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titer provides the best evidence for a correct diagnosis of anaplasmosis.

 Treatment
 
Doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages and should be initiated immediately whenever anaplasmosis is suspected. 
 
Use of antibiotics other than doxycycline or other tetracyclines has been associated with a higher risk of fatal outcome for some rickettsial infections. Doxycycline is most effective at preventing severe complications from developing if it is started early in the course of disease. Therefore, treatment must be based on clinical suspicion alone and should always begin before laboratory results return.
 
If the patient is treated within the first 5 days of the disease, fever generally subsides within 24-72 hours.  In fact, failure to respond to doxycycline suggests that the patient’s condition might not be due to anaplasmosis. Severely ill patients may require longer periods before their fever resolves. Resistance to doxcycline or relapses in symptoms after the completion of the recommended course have not been documented. 
 
Recommended Dosage
Doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages:
 
  - Adults: 100 mg every 12 hours
  - Children under 45 kg (100 lbs): 2.2 mg/kg body weight given twice a day
 
 
Patients should be treated for at least 3 days after the fever subsides and until there is evidence of clinical improvement. Standard duration of treatment is 7 to 14 days. Some patients may continue to experience headache, weakness and malaise for weeks after adequate treatment.
 Treating children
 
The use of doxycycline to treat suspected anaplasmosis in children is standard practice recommended by both CDC and the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases. Unlike older generations of tetracyclines, the recommended dose and duration of medication needed to treat anaplasmosis has not been shown to cause staining of permanent teeth, even when five courses are given before the age of eight.  Healthcare providers should use doxycycline as the first-line treatment for suspected anaplasmosis in patients of all ages. 
 Other Treatments
 
In cases of life threatening allergies to doxycycline and in some pregnant patients for whom the clinical course of anaplasmosis appears mild, physicians may need to consider alternate antibiotics. Although recommended as a second-line therapeutic alternative to treat Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever , chloramphenicol is not recommended for the treatment of anaplasmosis, as studies have shown a lack of efficacy. Rifampin has been used successfully in several pregnant women with anaplasmosis, and studies suggest that this drug appears effective against Anaplasma species. However, rifampin is not effective in treating RMSF, a disease that may be confused with anaplasmosis. Healthcare providers should be cautious when exploring treatments other than doxycycline, which is highly effective in treating both. Other antibiotics, including broad spectrum antibiotics are not considered highly effective against A. phagocytophilum, and the use of sulfa drugs during acute illness may worsen the severity of infection. 
 Prophylaxis (Preventive Treatment)
 
Antibiotic treatment following a tick bite is not recommended as a means to prevent anaplasmosis. There is no evidence this practice is effective, and this may simply delay onset of disease. Instead, persons who experience a tick bite should be alert for symptoms suggestive of tickborne illness and consult a physician if fever, rash, or other symptoms of concern develop.

 Other Considerations
 
The clinical presentation for anaplasmosis can resemble other tickborne diseases, such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and ehrlichiosis. Similar to anaplasmosis, these infections respond well to treatment with doxycycline. Healthcare providers should order diagnostic tests for additional agents if the clinical history and geographic association warrant.

2. Initial laboratory tests: The following tests are usually performed:
* Complete Blood Count (CBC) to assess for thrombocytopenia and leukopenia.
* Blood chemistry tests to evaluate liver and kidney function.
* Coagulation tests to assess bleeding tendency.
3. Viral detection: CHHF is caused by the Chapare virus, which can be detected using:
* Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) or Real-Time PCR to detect viral RNA in blood, serum, or other bodily fluids.
* Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) or Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to detect anti-Chapare virus antibodies in serum.
4. Serological testing: Serological tests, such as IFA or ELISA, can be used to detect IgM and IgG antibodies against the Chapare virus. IgM antibodies typically appear within 3-5 days of infection, while IgG antibodies appear later.
5. Epidemiological investigation: A thorough investigation of the patient's travel history, contact with animals, and potential exposure to the virus is essential to identify the source of infection.
6. Confirmation testing: In cases where the diagnosis is uncertain, confirmation testing using techniques such as virus isolation, sequencing, or gene amplification may be necessary.

However, as of October 2010, all VISA and VRSA isolates have been susceptible to other Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Persons who develop this type of staph infection may have underlying health conditions (such as diabetes and kidney disease), tubes going into their bodies (such as catheters), previous infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and recent exposure to vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents. What is Staphylococcus aureus? Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium commonly found on the skin and in the nose of about 30% of individuals. Most of the time, staph does not cause any harm. These infections can look like pimples, boils, or other skin conditions and most are able to be treated. Sometimes staph bacteria can get into the bloodstream and cause serious infections which can be fatal, including: Bacteremia or sepsis when bacteria spread to the bloodstream usually as a result of using catheters or having surgery. Pneumonia which predominantly affects people with underlying lung disease including those on mechanical ventilators. Endocarditis (infection of the heart valves) which can lead to heart failure. Osteomyelitis (bone infection) which can be caused by staph bacteria traveling in the bloodstream or put there by direct contact such as following trauma (puncture wound of foot or intravenous (IV) drug abuse). Top of page How do VISA and VRSA get their names? Staph bacteria are classified as VISA or VRSA based on laboratory tests. Laboratories perform tests to determine if staph bacteria are resistant to antimicrobial agents that might be used for treatment of infections. For vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents, laboratories determine how much of the agent it requires to inhibit the growth of the organism in a test tube. The result of the test is usually expressed as a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or the minimum amount of antimicrobial agent that inhibits bacterial growth in the test tube. Therefore, staph bacteria are classified as VISA if the MIC for vancomycin is 4-8µg/ml, and classified as VRSA if the vancomycin MIC is ≥16µg/ml.

Sometimes staph bacteria can get into the bloodstream and cause serious infections which can be fatal, including: Bacteremia or sepsis when bacteria spread to the bloodstream usually as a result of using catheters or having surgery. Pneumonia which predominantly affects people with underlying lung disease including those on mechanical ventilators. Endocarditis (infection of the heart valves) which can lead to heart failure. Osteomyelitis (bone infection) which can be caused by staph bacteria traveling in the bloodstream or put there by direct contact such as following trauma (puncture wound of foot or intravenous (IV) drug abuse). Top of page How do VISA and VRSA get their names? Staph bacteria are classified as VISA or VRSA based on laboratory tests. Laboratories perform tests to determine if staph bacteria are resistant to antimicrobial agents that might be used for treatment of infections. For vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents, laboratories determine how much of the agent it requires to inhibit the growth of the organism in a test tube. The result of the test is usually expressed as a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or the minimum amount of antimicrobial agent that inhibits bacterial growth in the test tube. Therefore, staph bacteria are classified as VISA if the MIC for vancomycin is 4-8µg/ml, and classified as VRSA if the vancomycin MIC is ≥16µg/ml.

67,What are the symptoms of Acinetobacter in Healthcare Settings ?,"Acinetobacter causes a variety of diseases, ranging from pneumonia to serious blood or wound infections, and the symptoms vary depending on the disease. Acinetobacter may also “colonize” or live in a patient without causing infection or symptoms, especially in tracheostomy sites or open wounds.","Acinetobacter infections, particularly Acinetobacter baumannii, are a significant concern in healthcare settings due to their ability to cause severe and often life-threatening illnesses. In healthcare settings, Acinetobacter infections can manifest in several ways:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Acinetobacter can cause pneumonia in patients who are mechanically ventilated, leading to respiratory failure and increased mortality.
2. Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs): Acinetobacter can infect central lines, causing bloodstream infections, sepsis, and organ failure.
3. Surgical site infections (SSIs): Acinetobacter can cause SSIs in patients who undergo surgical procedures, particularly those involving the skin and soft tissues.
4. Urinary tract infections (UTIs): Acinetobacter can cause UTIs in patients with indwelling urinary catheters or other urinary tract devices.
5. Skin and soft tissue infections: Acinetobacter can cause skin and soft tissue infections, such as abscesses, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis, particularly in patients with compromised skin integrity.
6. Meningitis: Acinetobacter can cause meningitis, particularly in patients who have undergone neurosurgical procedures or have a compromised central nervous system.
7. Endocarditis: Acinetobacter can cause endocarditis, particularly in patients with pre-existing heart valve disease or prosthetic heart valves.

Acinetobacter infections in healthcare settings are often associated with:

* Prolonged hospitalization
* Use of invasive devices (e.g., central lines, ventilators)
* Immunosuppression
* Presence of chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
* Poor wound care
* Inadequate hand hygiene and infection control practices

71,What is (are) Parasites - Lice - Body Lice ?,"Body lice are parasitic insects that live on clothing and bedding used by infested persons. Body lice frequently lay their eggs on or near the seams of clothing. Body lice must feed on blood and usually only move to the skin to feed. Body lice exist worldwide and infest people of all races. Body lice infestations can spread rapidly under crowded living conditions where hygiene is poor (the homeless, refugees, victims of war or natural disasters). In the United States, body lice infestations are found only in homeless transient populations who do not have access to bathing and regular changes of clean clothes. Infestation is unlikely to persist on anyone who bathes regularly and who has at least weekly access to freshly laundered clothing and bedding.","I'd be happy to help clarify the differences between parasites, lice, and body lice.

**Parasites**: A parasite is an organism that lives on or in another organism (the host), obtaining its nutrients and shelter from the host. Parasites can be external (living on the surface of the host) or internal (living inside the host's body). Examples of parasites include tapeworms, fleas, ticks, and mites.

**Lice**: Lice are a type of external parasite that lives on the skin or hair of a host. They feed on the host's blood, skin cells, or other substances. There are several types of lice that infest humans, including:

* Head lice (Pediculus capitis): live on the scalp and feed on human blood
* Body lice (Pediculus humanus corporis): live on the skin and feed on human blood
* Pubic lice (Phthirus pubis): live in pubic hair and feed on human blood
* Crab lice (Phthirus pubis): live in pubic hair and feed on human blood

**Body Lice**: Body lice (Pediculus humanus corporis) are a type of lice that infest the skin, particularly in areas where clothing is worn tightly, such as the armpits, waistline, and groin. Body lice feed on human blood and can cause discomfort, itching, and skin irritation. They are often associated with poor hygiene, overcrowding, and poverty.

It's important to note that body lice are different from head lice, which infest the scalp and hair. Body lice are more commonly found in areas where clothing is worn tightly, whereas head lice are more commonly found in areas where hair is present.

Infestations can spread rapidly under such conditions. Body lice infestation can occur in people of all races.
   
Body lice are spread through direct contact with a person who has body lice or through contact with articles such as clothing, beds, bed linens, or towels that have been in contact with an infested person. However, in the United States, actual infestation with body lice tends to be occur only in homeless, transient persons who do not have access to regular bathing and changes of clean clothes.
   
Body lice can transmit disease. Epidemics of typhus and louse-borne relapsing fever have been caused by body lice (typically in areas where climate, poverty, and social customs or war and social upheaval prevent regular changes and laundering of clothing).","Body lice (Pediculus humanus corporis) are more likely to affect certain populations, including:

Here are the steps to diagnose and identify body lice:

1. Physical Examination: A healthcare provider will perform a thorough physical examination of the patient's body, paying attention to areas where lice are most commonly found, such as the neck, armpits, and groin.
2. Look for Signs of Infestation: The healthcare provider will look for signs of infestation, such as:
* Live lice crawling on the skin
* Nits (eggs) attached to hair or skin
* Redness, itching, or inflammation of the skin
* Small, red bumps or blisters
3. Medical History: The healthcare provider will ask questions about the patient's medical history, including:
* Recent travel or exposure to others with lice
* Recent use of public showers, pools, or saunas
* Recent contact with someone who has lice
4. Laboratory Tests: In some cases, laboratory tests may be performed to confirm the diagnosis. These tests may include:
* Skin scraping: A sample of skin is taken and examined under a microscope for lice or nits.
* Hair combing: A fine-tooth comb is used to remove lice and nits from the hair.
* Wet mount preparation: A sample of skin or hair is mixed with a special solution and examined under a microscope for lice or nits.
5. Identification of Lice: The healthcare provider will examine the patient's skin and hair under a microscope or with a magnifying glass to identify the lice. Body lice are typically small, grayish-white, and have six legs.
6. Confirmation of Diagnosis: The healthcare provider will confirm the diagnosis by identifying the lice and nits on the patient's skin and hair.

Sometimes the infested person also is treated with a pediculicide, a medicine that can kill lice; however, a pediculicide generally is not necessary if hygiene is maintained and items are laundered appropriately at least once a week. A pediculicide should be applied exactly as directed on the bottle or by your physician.
   
If you choose to treat, guidelines for the choice of the pediculicide are the same as for head lice.
   
More on: Head Lice Treatment","Parasites, including lice, can be a frustrating and uncomfortable issue. Here are some medical solutions for body lice infestations:

**Treatment Options:**

1. **Permethrin Cream Rinse**: Over-the-counter (OTC) creams or shampoos containing permethrin can be applied to the affected areas and left on for 10-15 minutes before rinsing off. This is the most effective treatment for body lice.
2. **Ivermectin**: Oral ivermectin is sometimes prescribed for body lice infestations, especially in cases where the infestation is severe or widespread.
3. **Lindane**: Lindane is a topical treatment that can be applied to the affected areas. However, it's not as effective as permethrin and has a higher risk of side effects.
4. **Combination Therapy**: In severe cases, a combination of permethrin cream rinse and oral ivermectin may be prescribed.

**Prevention and Control:**

1. **Wash and Dry Clothing**: Wash and dry clothing, bedding, and towels in hot water and high heat to kill lice and their eggs.

76,How to diagnose Tuberculosis (TB) ?,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease that is spread through the air from one person to another. There are two kinds of tests that are used to determine if a person has been infected with TB bacteria: the tuberculin skin test and TB blood tests.
 
A positive TB skin test or TB blood test only tells that a person has been infected with TB bacteria. It does not tell whether the person has latent TB infection (LTBI) or has progressed to TB disease. Other tests, such as a chest x-ray and a sample of sputum, are needed to see whether the person has TB disease.
 
Tuberculin skin test: The TB skin test (also called the Mantoux tuberculin skin test) is performed by injecting a small amount of fluid (called tuberculin) into the skin in the lower part of the arm. A person given the tuberculin skin test must return within 48 to 72 hours to have a trained health care worker look for a reaction on the arm. The health care worker will look for a raised, hard area or swelling, and if present, measure its size using a ruler. Redness by itself is not considered part of the reaction.
 
The skin test result depends on the size of the raised, hard area or swelling. It also depends on the person’s risk of being infected with TB bacteria and the progression to TB disease if infected.
  
   - Positive skin test: This
     means the person’s body was infected with TB bacteria. Additional tests are needed to determine if the person has latent TB infection or TB disease. A health care worker will then provide treatment as needed.
   - Negative skin test: This means the person’s body did not react to the test, and that latent TB infection or TB disease is not likely.
  
 
 
     TB blood tests:
    TB blood tests (also called interferon-gamma release assays or IGRAs) measure how the immune system reacts to the bacteria that cause TB. An IGRA measures how strong a person’s immune system reacts to TB bacteria by testing the person’s blood in a laboratory.
 
Two IGRAs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are available in the United States:
  
   - QuantiFERON®–TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-GIT)
   - T-SPOT®.TB test (T-Spot)
  
  
   - Positive IGRA: This means that the person has been infected with TB bacteria. Additional tests are needed to determine if the person has latent TB infection or TB disease. A health care worker will then provide treatment as needed.
   - Negative IGRA: This means that the person’s blood did not react to the test and that latent TB infection or TB disease is not likely.
  
 
IGRAs are the preferred method of TB infection testing for the following:
   
   - People who have a difficult time returning for a second appointment to look for a reaction to the TST.
  
 
There is no problem with repeated IGRAs.
   
  
  
     Testing for TB in BCG-Vaccinated Persons
 
Many people born outside of the United States have been BCG-vaccinated.
 
People who have had a previous BCG vaccine may receive a TB skin test. In some people, BCG may cause a positive skin test when they are not infected with TB bacteria. If a TB skin test is positive, additional tests are needed.
 
IGRAs, unlike the TB skin tests, are not affected by prior BCG vaccination and are not expected to give a false-positive result in people who have received BCG.
  
     Choosing a TB Test
 
The person’s health care provider should choose which TB test to use. Factors in selecting which test to use include the reason for testing, test availability, and cost. Generally, it is not recommended to test a person with both a TST and an IGRA.
  
     Diagnosis of Latent TB Infection or TB Disease
 
If a person is found to be infected with TB bacteria, other tests are needed to see if the person has TB disease.
 
TB disease can be diagnosed by medical history, physical examination, chest x-ray, and other laboratory tests. TB disease is treated by taking several drugs as recommended by a health care provider.
 
If a person does not have TB disease, but has TB bacteria in the body, then latent TB infection is diagnosed. The decision about treatment for latent TB infection will be based on a person’s chances of developing TB disease.
  
     Diagnosis of TB Disease
 
People suspected of having TB disease should be referred for a medical evaluation, which will include
  
   - Medical history,
   - Physical examination,
   - Test for TB infection (TB skin test or TB blood test),
   - Chest radiograph (X-ray), and
   - Appropriate laboratory tests

   For Health Care Providers","Diagnosing Tuberculosis (TB) typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Here are the steps involved in diagnosing TB:

1. Medical History: The doctor will ask about your symptoms, such as cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats. They will also ask about your travel history, occupation, and any contact with someone who has TB.
2. Physical Examination: The doctor will perform a physical examination to look for signs of TB, such as cough, chest pain, and abnormal lung sounds.
3. Tuberculin Skin Test (TST): A TST is a simple test that involves injecting a small amount of tuberculin protein into the skin. If you have been infected with TB, your immune system will react to the protein, causing a raised bump (induration) at the injection site.
4. Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA): IGRA is a blood test that measures the immune system's response to TB bacteria. It is used to diagnose latent TB infection (LTBI) and active TB disease.
5. Chest X-ray: A chest X-ray is used to visualize the lungs and detect any abnormalities, such as nodules, cavities, or pleural effusion (fluid accumulation around the lungs).
6. Sputum Examination: Sputum is a sample of mucus coughed up from the lungs. It is examined under a microscope to look for TB bacteria.
7. GeneXpert Test: GeneXpert is a molecular diagnostic test that detects TB bacteria in sputum samples. It is highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing active TB disease.
8. Culture Test: A culture test involves growing TB bacteria in a laboratory to confirm the diagnosis.
9. Clinical Evaluation: The doctor will evaluate your symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory test results to determine the likelihood of TB infection or disease.

It's important to note that diagnosing TB can be challenging, especially in people who have been infected with TB but do not have symptoms. A combination of these tests and clinical evaluation is often necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",No harm,Low,No harm,Low,No harm,Low
77,How to prevent Tuberculosis (TB) ?,"Infection Control in Health Care Settings
 
Tuberculosis (TB) transmission has been documented in health care settings where health care workers and patients come in contact with people who have TB disease.
 
People who work or receive care in health care settings are at higher risk for becoming infected with TB; therefore, it is necessary to have a TB infection control plan as part of a general infection control program designed to ensure the following:
 
   - prompt detection of infectious patients,
   - airborne precautions, and
   - treatment of people who have suspected or confirmed TB disease.
 
 
In order to be effective, the primary emphasis of a TB infection control program should be on achieving these three goals.
 
In all health care settings, particularly those in which people are at high risk for exposure to TB, policies and procedures for TB control should be developed, reviewed periodically, and evaluated for effectiveness to determine the actions necessary to minimize the risk for transmission of TB.
 
The TB infection control program should be based on a three-level hierarchy of control measures and include:
 
   - Administrative measures
   - Environmental controls
   - Use of respiratory protective equipment
 
 
The first and most important level of the hierarchy, administrative measures, impacts the largest number of people. It is intended primarily to reduce the risk of uninfected people who are exposed to people who have TB disease.
 
The second level of the hierarchy is the use of environmental controls to reduce the amount of TB in the air. The first two control levels of the hierarchy also minimize the number of areas in the health care setting where exposure to TB may occur.
 
The third level of the hierarchy is the use of respiratory protective equipment in situations that pose a high risk of exposure to TB. Use of respiratory protection equipment can further reduce the risk for exposure of health care workers.

     TB Prevention
 
Preventing Exposure to TB Disease While Traveling Abroad
Travelers should avoid close contact or prolonged time with known TB patients in crowded, enclosed environments (for example, clinics, hospitals, prisons, or homeless shelters).
 
Travelers who will be working in clinics, hospitals, or other health care settings where TB patients are likely to be encountered should consult infection control or occupational health experts. They should ask about administrative and environmental procedures for preventing exposure to TB. Once those procedures are implemented, additional measures could include using personal respiratory protective devices.
 
Travelers who anticipate possible prolonged exposure to people with TB (for example, those who expect to come in contact routinely with clinic, hospital, prison, or homeless shelter populations) should have a tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) test before leaving the United States. If the test reaction is negative, they should have a repeat test 8 to 10 weeks after returning to the United States. Additionally, annual testing may be recommended for those who anticipate repeated or prolonged exposure or an extended stay over a period of years. Because people with HIV infection are more likely to have an impaired response to both the TST and IGRA, travelers who are HIV positive should tell their physicians about their HIV infection status.

     Preventing Latent TB Infection from Progressing to TB Disease
 
Many people who have latent TB infection never develop TB disease. But some people who have latent TB infection are more likely to develop TB disease than others. Those at high risk for developing TB disease include:
 
   - People with HIV infection
   - People who became infected with TB bacteria in the last 2 years
   - Babies and young children
   - People who inject illegal drugs
   - People who are sick with other diseases that weaken the immune system
   - Elderly people
   - People who were not treated correctly for TB in the past
 
 
If you have latent TB infection and you are in one of these high-risk groups, you should take medicine to keep from developing TB disease. There are several treatment options for latent TB infection. You and your health care provider must decide which treatment is best for you. If you take your medicine as instructed, it can keep you from developing TB disease. Because there are less bacteria, treatment for latent TB infection is much easier than treatment for TB disease. A person with TB disease has a large amount of TB bacteria in the body. Several drugs are needed to treat TB disease.","Preventing Tuberculosis (TB) requires a combination of individual and community-based measures. Here are some effective preventive measures:

1. **BCG vaccination**: The Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is effective in preventing severe forms of TB, such as meningitis and disseminated TB, in children and adults.
2. **Screening and testing**: Regular screening and testing for TB, especially in high-risk populations, can help identify and treat cases early, reducing transmission.
3. **Good hygiene**: Practicing good hygiene, such as covering the mouth and nose when coughing, washing hands regularly, and avoiding close contact with people who have TB, can help prevent transmission.
4. **Proper ventilation**: Ensuring good ventilation in homes, schools, and workplaces can help reduce the concentration of TB bacteria in the air.
5. **Contact tracing**: Identifying and testing people who have been in close contact with someone who has TB can help prevent transmission.
6. **TB treatment**: Completing the full course of TB treatment, as prescribed by a healthcare provider, is crucial to preventing the development of drug-resistant TB.
7. **Healthy lifestyle**: Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep, can help boost the immune system and reduce the risk of developing TB.
8. **Avoiding close contact with people who have TB**: Avoiding close contact with people who have TB, especially in crowded or poorly ventilated areas, can help prevent transmission.
9. **Wearing a mask**: Wearing a mask when in close proximity to someone who has TB can help reduce the risk of transmission.
10. **Community-based interventions**: Implementing community-based interventions, such as education and awareness campaigns, can help reduce the incidence of TB in high-risk populations.

78,What are the treatments for Tuberculosis (TB) ?,"Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The bacteria usually attack the lungs, but TB bacteria can attack any part of the body such as the kidney, spine, and brain. If not treated properly, TB disease can be fatal.
 
Not everyone infected with TB bacteria becomes sick. As a result, two TB-related conditions exist: latent TB infection and TB disease. Both latent TB infection and TB disease can be treated. Learn more about the difference between latent TB infection and TB disease.
 
     Treatment for Latent TB Infection
 
People with latent TB infection have TB bacteria in their bodies, but they are not sick because the bacteria are not active. People with latent TB infection do not have symptoms, and they cannot spread TB bacteria to others. However, if TB bacteria become active in the body and multiply, the person will go from having latent TB infection to being sick with TB disease. For this reason, people with latent TB infection are often prescribed treatment to prevent them from developing TB disease. Treatment of latent TB infection is essential for controlling and eliminating TB in the United States.
 
Because there are less bacteria in a person with latent TB infection, treatment is much easier. Four regimens are approved for the treatment of latent TB infection. The medications used to treat latent TB infection include:
 
   - isoniazid (INH)
   - rifampin (RIF)
   - rifapentine (RPT)
 
 
Certain groups of people (such as people with weakened immune systems) are at very high risk of developing TB disease once infected with TB bacteria. Every effort should be made to begin appropriate treatment and to ensure completion of the entire course of treatment for latent TB infection.
 
More: Treatment for Latent TB Infection
 
     Treatment for TB Disease
 
TB bacteria become active (multiplying in the body) if the immune system can't stop them from growing. When TB bacteria are active, this is called TB disease. TB disease will make a person sick. People with TB disease may spread the bacteria to people with whom they spend many hours.
 
TB disease can be treated by taking several drugs for 6 to 9 months. There are 10 drugs currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating TB. Of the approved drugs, the first-line anti-TB agents that form the core of treatment regimens include:
 
   - isoniazid (INH)
   - rifampin (RIF)
   - ethambutol (EMB)
   - pyrazinamide (PZA)
 
 
Regimens for treating TB disease have an initial phase of 2 months, followed by a choice of several options for the continuation phase of either 4 or 7 months (total of 6 to 9 months for treatment). Learn more about the continuation phase of treatment.
 
It is very important that people who have TB disease finish the medicine, taking the drugs exactly as prescribed. If they stop taking the drugs too soon, they can become sick again; if they do not take the drugs correctly, the TB bacteria that are still alive may become resistant to those drugs. TB that is resistant to drugs is harder and more expensive to treat.

     Treatment Completion
 
Treatment completion is determined by the number of doses ingested over a given period of time. Although basic TB regimens are broadly applicable, there are modifications that should be made under special circumstances (such as people with HIV infection, drug resistance, pregnancy, or treatment of children).","Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The treatment for TB typically involves a combination of antibiotics, which are usually taken for several months. The most common treatments for TB include:

1. Antibiotic medications: The most effective treatment for TB is a combination of antibiotics, which are usually taken for 6-12 months. The most commonly used antibiotics for TB are:
* Isoniazid (INH)
* Rifampicin (RIF)
* Pyrazinamide (PZA)
* Ethambutol (EMB)
* Streptomycin (STR)
2. Directly Observed Therapy (DOTS): To ensure that patients take their medication correctly, DOTS involves observing patients take their medication directly under the supervision of a healthcare worker.
3. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) treatment: For patients with MDR-TB, treatment typically involves a longer course of antibiotics, often including second-line drugs such as:
* Fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin)
* Aminoglycosides (e.g., kanamycin)
* Capreomycin
* Cycloserine
4. Treatment for latent TB: For patients who have been exposed to TB but do not have active disease, treatment typically involves taking antibiotics for 3-9 months to prevent the development of active TB. The most commonly used antibiotics for latent TB are:
* Isoniazid (INH)
* Rifampicin (RIF)
* Pyrazinamide (PZA)

Here are the steps involved in diagnosing pubic lice:

1. Medical History: Your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms, such as itching, redness, and swelling in the genital area. They will also ask about your sexual history and any recent changes in your sexual partners.
2. Physical Examination: Your doctor will perform a physical examination of your genital area, looking for signs of lice infestation, such as:
* Live lice crawling on the skin
* Nits (eggs) attached to hair or skin
* Redness, swelling, or inflammation
* Small, raised bumps or papules
3. Visual Inspection: Your doctor may use a magnifying glass or a special light to help visualize the lice and nits.
4. Wet Mount Preparation: If the doctor suspects an infestation, they may prepare a wet mount by mixing a small amount of water with a few drops of soap. This helps to loosen the lice and nits, making them easier to see.
5. Microscopic Examination: Your doctor may use a microscope to examine the wet mount preparation, looking for lice and nits.
6. Nits Identification: Nits are usually found attached to hair or skin, and are difficult to distinguish from other skin conditions. Your doctor may use a special tool or a cotton swab to gently remove nits from the skin, and then examine them under a microscope to confirm the presence of lice.

91,"How to prevent Parasites - Lice - Pubic ""Crab"" Lice ?","Pubic (""crab"") lice most commonly are spread directly from person to person by sexual contact. Pubic lice very rarely may be spread by clothing, bedding, or a toilet seat.
   
The following are steps that can be taken to help prevent and control the spread of pubic (""crab"") lice:
   
     - All sexual contacts of the infested person should be examined. All those who are infested should be treated.
     - Sexual contact between the infested person(s)s and their sexual partner(s) should be avoided until all have been examined, treated as necessary, and reevaluated to rule out persistent infestation.
     - Machine wash and dry clothing worn and bedding used by the infested person in the hot water (at least 130°F) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle. Clothing and items that are not washable can be dry-cleaned OR sealed in a plastic bag and stored for 2 weeks.
     - Do not share clothing, bedding, and towels used by an infested person.
     - Do not use fumigant sprays or fogs; they are not necessary to control pubic (""crab"") lice and can be toxic if inhaled or absorbed through the skin.
   
   
Persons with pubic lice should be examined and treated for any other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) that may be present.","Preventing pubic lice infestation, also known as crabs, requires a combination of good hygiene, safe sex practices, and avoiding sharing personal items. Here are some best practices to help you avoid getting infested:

1. Practice safe sex: Use condoms or other forms of barrier protection during sexual activities to reduce the risk of transmission.
2. Avoid sharing personal items: Refrain from sharing towels, washcloths, or clothing with someone who has pubic lice. This includes sharing underwear, socks, or bedding.
3. Keep your genital area clean: Regularly wash your genital area with soap and water, and dry it thoroughly to reduce the risk of infestation.
4. Avoid close contact: Avoid close contact with someone who has pubic lice, especially if you're not in a sexual relationship with them.
5. Use a lice-repelling soap: Some soaps contain ingredients that can help repel pubic lice. Look for soaps that contain ingredients like tea tree oil or lavender oil.
6. Avoid sharing hair accessories: Pubic lice can also infest the hair on your head, so avoid sharing hair accessories like combs, brushes, or hair ties.
7. Wash your clothes regularly: Wash your clothes, especially underwear and bedding, regularly to reduce the risk of infestation.
8. Dry your clothes thoroughly: Make sure to dry your clothes thoroughly, especially underwear and bedding, to kill any lice that may be present.
9. Avoid sharing personal care items: Avoid sharing personal care items like razors, scissors, or makeup brushes.
10. Get regular check-ups: If you're in a sexual relationship, consider getting regular check-ups to detect any potential infestations early on.

Remember, prevention is key. By following these best practices, you can reduce your risk of getting infested with pubic lice.

92,What is (are) Parasites - Fascioliasis (Fasciola Infection) ?,"Fascioliasis is an infectious disease caused by Fasciola parasites, which are flat worms referred to as liver flukes. The adult (mature) flukes are found in the bile ducts and liver of infected people and animals, such as sheep and cattle. In general, fascioliasis is more common in livestock and other animals than in people.
Two Fasciola species (types) infect people. The main species is Fasciola hepatica, which is also known as ""the common liver fluke"" and ""the sheep liver fluke."" A related species, Fasciola gigantica, also can infect people.","Fascioliasis is a parasitic infection caused by the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica. It is commonly found in areas where contaminated water or food is consumed, and it is typically spread through the ingestion of infected snails, frogs, or other aquatic animals. The infection can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and liver damage if left untreated.",No harm,Low,No harm,Low,Moderate or mild harm,Low
93,Who is at risk for Parasites - Fascioliasis (Fasciola Infection)? ?,"Fascioliasis occurs in many areas of the world and usually is caused by F. hepatica, which is a common liver fluke of sheep and cattle. In general, fascioliasis is more common and widespread in animals than in people. Even so, the number of infected people in the world is thought to exceed 2 million.
   
Fasciola hepatica is found in more than 50 countries, in all continents except Antarctica. It is found in parts of Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Fasciola gigantica is less widespread. Human cases have been reported in the tropics, in parts of Africa and Asia, and also in Hawaii.
   
In some areas where fascioliasis is found, human cases are uncommon (sporadic). In other areas, human fascioliasis is very common (hyperendemic). For example, the areas with the highest known rates of human infection are in the Andean highlands of Bolivia and Peru.
   
Special conditions are needed for fascioliasis to be present in an area, and its geographic distribution is very patchy (focal). The eggs passed in the stool of infected mammals have to develop (mature) in a suitable aquatic snail host to be able to infect another mammalian host. Requirements include sufficient moisture and favorable temperatures (above 50°F) that allow the development of miracidia, reproduction of snails, and larval development within the snails. These factors also contribute to both the prevalence and level (intensity) of infection. Prevalence is highest in areas where climatic conditions promote development of cercariae.
   
More on: Biology
   
Infective Fasciola larvae (metacercariae) are found in contaminated water, either stuck to (encysted on) water plants or floating in the water, often in marshy areas, ponds, or flooded pastures. People (and animals) typically become infected by eating raw watercress or other contaminated water plants. The plants may be eaten as a snack or in salads or sandwiches. People also can get infected by ingesting contaminated water, such as by drinking it or by eating vegetables that were washed or irrigated with contaminated water. Infection also can result from eating undercooked sheep or goat livers that contain immature forms of the parasite.
   
The possibility of becoming infected in the United States should be considered, despite the fact that few locally acquired cases have been documented. The prerequisites for the Fasciola life cycle exist in some parts of the United States. In addition, transmission because of imported contaminated produce could occur, as has been documented in Europe.","Fascioliasis, caused by the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica, is a significant public health concern in many parts of the world. The populations most vulnerable to Fasciola infection are:

1. Agricultural workers: People who work in agricultural settings, particularly those who handle livestock or crops, are at higher risk of infection.
2. Children: Children are more susceptible to infection due to their developing immune systems and frequent contact with contaminated water and food.
3. People living in rural areas: Rural communities, especially those with limited access to clean water and sanitation, are more likely to be infected.
4. Refugees and migrants: Refugees and migrants may be at higher risk due to their displacement and potential exposure to contaminated water and food sources.
5. People with compromised immune systems: Individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or taking immunosuppressive therapy, are more susceptible to severe infections.
6. Pregnant women: Pregnant women are at higher risk due to the potential for the parasite to affect fetal development and the mother's health.
7. People living in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene: Communities with inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices are more likely to have high rates of Fasciola infection.

It's essential to note that Fasciola infection can occur in anyone who ingests contaminated water or food, so it's crucial to practice good hygiene and food handling practices to reduce the risk of infection.",No harm,Low,Moderate or mild harm,Low,Moderate or mild harm,Low
94,How to diagnose Parasites - Fascioliasis (Fasciola Infection) ?,"The standard way to be sure a person is infected with Fasciola is by seeing the parasite. This is usually done by finding Fasciola eggs in stool (fecal) specimens examined under a microscope. More than one specimen may need to be examined to find the parasite. Sometimes eggs are found by examining duodenal contents or bile.
   
Infected people don't start passing eggs until they have been infected for several months; people don't pass eggs during the acute phase of the infection. Therefore, early on, the infection has to be diagnosed in other ways than by examining stool. Even during the chronic phase of infection, it can be difficult to find eggs in stool specimens from people who have light infections.
   
Certain types of blood tests can be helpful for diagnosing Fasciola infection, including routine blood work and tests that detect antibodies (an immune response) to the parasite.
   
More on: Resources for Health Professionals: Diagnosis","Fasciola infection, also known as fascioliasis, is a parasitic infection caused by the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica. To diagnose fascioliasis, healthcare providers typically follow these diagnostic steps:

1. Medical history: The patient's medical history is taken to identify any symptoms, travel history, and potential exposure to contaminated water or food.
2. Physical examination: A thorough physical examination is performed to look for signs of liver disease, such as jaundice, abdominal tenderness, or hepatomegaly (enlarged liver).
3. Laboratory tests:
* Complete Blood Count (CBC): To check for signs of liver damage, such as elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT) or anemia.
* Liver function tests (LFTs): To assess liver function and detect any damage.
* Serological tests: Such as ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) or Western blot, to detect antibodies against Fasciola hepatica in the patient's blood.
* Stool examination: To detect the parasite's eggs or larvae in the patient's stool.
4. Imaging tests:
* Ultrasound: To visualize the liver and detect any abnormalities, such as liver cysts or abscesses.
* Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): To confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of liver damage.
5. Endoscopy: In some cases, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may be performed to visualize the bile ducts and detect any signs of obstruction or damage.
6. Parasitological examination: A parasitological examination of the patient's stool or bile may be performed to detect the parasite's eggs or larvae.
7. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) or DNA testing: To detect the presence of Fasciola hepatica DNA in the patient's blood, stool, or liver tissue.

The diagnosis of fascioliasis is often confirmed by a combination of these diagnostic steps. Treatment typically involves antiparasitic medication, and in severe cases, surgical intervention may be necessary.",No harm,Low,No harm,Low,Moderate or mild harm,Low
95,What are the treatments for Parasites - Fascioliasis (Fasciola Infection) ?,"The first step is to make sure the diagnosis is correct. For more information, patients should consult their health care provider. Health care providers may consult with CDC staff about the diagnosis and treatment of fascioliasis.
   
The drug of choice is triclabendazole. In the United States, this drug is available through CDC, under a special (investigational) protocol. The drug is given by mouth, usually in one or two doses. Most people respond well to the treatment.
   
More on: Resources for Health Professionals: Treatment","Fascioliasis, also known as fasciola infection, is a parasitic disease caused by the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica. The medical approaches to managing parasites - Fascioliasis (Fasciola Infection) typically involve a combination of the following:

1. **Antiparasitic medications**: The primary treatment for fascioliasis is anthelmintic medication, such as triclabendazole (Fluxile), which is effective against the liver fluke. The medication is usually administered orally or intravenously.
2. **Praziquantel**: This medication is also effective against Fasciola hepatica and is often used in combination with triclabendazole.
3. **Supportive care**: Patients may require supportive care, such as fluid replacement, electrolyte management, and nutritional support, to manage symptoms and prevent complications.
4. **Surgical intervention**: In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to remove the fluke from the bile ducts or liver.
5. **Preventive measures**: To prevent re-infection, patients should avoid consuming contaminated water or food, and practice good hygiene, such as washing hands regularly.
6. **Monitoring**: Patients with fascioliasis should be closely monitored for signs of complications, such as liver damage, bile duct obstruction, or pancreatitis.
7. **Combination therapy**: In severe cases or when the infection is resistant to monotherapy, combination therapy with multiple antiparasitic medications may be necessary.

96,How to prevent Parasites - Fascioliasis (Fasciola Infection) ?,"No vaccine is available to protect people against Fasciola infection.
   
In some areas of the world where fascioliasis is found (endemic), special control programs are in place or are planned. The types of control measures depend on the setting (such as epidemiologic, ecologic, and cultural factors). Strict control of the growth and sale of watercress and other edible water plants is important.
   
Individual people can protect themselves by not eating raw watercress and other water plants, especially from endemic grazing areas. As always, travelers to areas with poor sanitation should avoid food and water that might be contaminated (tainted). Vegetables grown in fields that might have been irrigated with polluted water should be thoroughly cooked, as should viscera from potentially infected animals.","Fascioliasis is a parasitic infection caused by the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica. To prevent it, take the following measures:

1. **Avoid eating raw or undercooked aquatic plants**: F. hepatica larvae are often found in watercress, spinach, and other aquatic plants. Cooking or boiling these plants can kill the larvae.
2. **Wash hands thoroughly**: Before handling or eating aquatic plants, wash your hands with soap and water to prevent accidental ingestion of larvae.
3. **Use proper food handling and storage**: Store food in sealed containers and avoid cross-contamination with potentially contaminated food.
4. **Avoid drinking untreated water**: Avoid drinking water from lakes, rivers, or ponds where the parasite is common. Instead, use treated or boiled water.
5. **Wear protective clothing**: When working in areas where the parasite is common, wear protective clothing, such as gloves and a mask, to prevent accidental ingestion of larvae.
6. **Get regular check-ups**: If you live in an area where fascioliasis is common, get regular check-ups with your doctor to monitor your liver health and detect any potential infections early.

97,what are the signs and symptoms of rabies?,"The first symptoms of rabies may be very similar to those of the flu including general weakness or discomfort, fever, or headache. These symptoms may last for days.
               
There may be also discomfort or a prickling or itching sensation at the site of bite, progressing within days to symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, agitation. As the disease progresses, the person may experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, and insomnia.
               
The acute period of disease typically ends after 2 to 10 days. Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal, and treatment is typically supportive.
               
Disease prevention includes administration of both passive antibody, through an injection of human immune globulin and a round of injections with rabies vaccine.

**Early Stage (1-2 weeks after exposure):**

* Flu-like symptoms: fever, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, and general malaise
* Mild itching or tingling at the site of the bite or scratch
* Mild swelling or redness at the site of the bite or scratch

**Intermediate Stage (2-4 weeks after exposure):**

* Increased salivation and foaming at the mouth
* Agitation, anxiety, and restlessness
* Increased sensitivity to light and sound
* Muscle spasms and twitching
* Confusion, disorientation, and altered mental status

**Late Stage (4-6 weeks after exposure):**

* Severe anxiety, agitation, and restlessness
* Increased aggression and irritability
* Confusion, disorientation, and altered mental status
* Difficulty swallowing and speaking
* Hydrophobia (fear of water) due to the pain and discomfort caused by swallowing
* Seizures, convulsions, and coma

**Final Stage (6-12 weeks after exposure):**

* Complete paralysis of the face, arms, and legs
* Loss of coordination and balance
* Inability to swallow, speak, or move
* Coma and eventually, death

98,what is the risk for my pet for Rabies ?,"Any animal bitten or scratched by either a wild, carnivorous mammal or a bat that is not available for testing should be regarded as having been exposed to rabies.
 
Unvaccinated dogs, cats, and ferrets exposed to a rabid animal should be euthanized immediately. If the owner is unwilling to have this done, the animal should be placed in strict isolation for 6 months and vaccinated 1 month before being released.
 
Animals with expired vaccinations need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Dogs and cats that are currently vaccinated are kept under observation for 45 days.
 
Small mammals such as squirrels, rats, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, chipmunks, rabbits, and hares are almost never found to be infected with rabies and have not been known to cause rabies among humans in the United States. Bites by these animals are usually not considered a risk of rabies unless the animal was sick or behaving in any unusual manner and rabies is widespread in your area.
 
However, from 1985 through 1994, woodchucks accounted for 86% of the 368 cases of rabies among rodents reported to CDC.

Rabies is a serious disease that can affect any mammal, including your pet. The susceptibility of your pet to Rabies depends on several factors:

1. Species: Rabies is most common in wild animals like raccoons, bats, and skunks. Domesticated animals like dogs, cats, and ferrets can also contract Rabies, but it's less common.
2. Vaccination: If your pet is up-to-date on its Rabies vaccination, it's much less likely to contract the disease. The vaccination provides immunity against Rabies, and it's usually administered every 1-3 years, depending on the type of vaccine and your pet's age.
3. Exposure: If your pet is exposed to an infected animal, such as through a bite or scratch, it's more likely to contract Rabies. The risk of exposure is higher if your pet spends time outdoors, especially at night, or if it's in an area with a high incidence of Rabies.
4. Age: Younger pets, especially those under 6 months old, are more susceptible to Rabies due to their immature immune systems.

To minimize the risk of Rabies in your pet:

* Keep your pet indoors, especially at night, to reduce the risk of exposure.
* Ensure your pet is up-to-date on its Rabies vaccination.
* Avoid letting your pet interact with wild animals or stray animals that may be infected.
* Report any animal bites or scratches to your veterinarian immediately.

99,how is rabies diagnosed?,"In animals, rabies is diagnosed using the direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test, which looks for the presence of rabies virus antigens in brain tissue. In humans, several tests are required.
 
Rapid and accurate laboratory diagnosis of rabies in humans and other animals is essential for timely administration of postexposure prophylaxis. Within a few hours, a diagnostic laboratory can determine whether or not an animal is rabid and inform the responsible medical personnel. The laboratory results may save a patient from unnecessary physical and psychological trauma, and financial burdens, if the animal is not rabid.
 
In addition, laboratory identification of positive rabies cases may aid in defining current epidemiologic patterns of disease and provide appropriate information for the development of rabies control programs.
 
The nature of rabies disease dictates that laboratory tests be standardized, rapid, sensitive, specific, economical, and reliable.","Confirming a case of rabies requires a thorough diagnostic process. Here are the steps involved:

1. Clinical evaluation: The patient's medical history, symptoms, and physical examination are assessed to identify any signs of rabies, such as unusual behavior, aggression, or paralysis.
2. Fluorescent antibody test (FAT): A sample of the patient's skin or hair is taken and examined for the presence of rabies virus antigens using a fluorescent antibody.
3. Immunohistochemistry (IHC): A biopsy sample of the patient's brain or other affected tissues is examined for the presence of rabies virus antigens using immunohistochemical staining.
4. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR): A sample of the patient's saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, or other bodily fluids is tested for the presence of rabies virus genetic material using RT-PCR.
5. Virus isolation: A sample of the patient's saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, or other bodily fluids is cultured to isolate the rabies virus.
6. Serology: The patient's blood is tested for the presence of rabies virus antibodies using a serological test, such as the rapid fluorescent focus assay (RFFA) or the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFA).
7. Post-mortem examination: In cases where the patient has died, a post-mortem examination is performed to confirm the diagnosis of rabies.

It's important to note that a diagnosis of rabies can only be confirmed by a laboratory test, and a clinical diagnosis alone is not sufficient.

101,What are the symptoms of Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM) ?,"LCMV is most commonly recognized as causing neurological disease, as its name implies, though infection without symptoms or mild febrile illnesses are more common clinical manifestations.
               
For infected persons who do become ill, onset of symptoms usually occurs 8-13 days after exposure to the virus as part of a biphasic febrile illness. This initial phase, which may last as long as a week, typically begins with any or all of the following symptoms: fever, malaise, lack of appetite, muscle aches, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms appearing less frequently include sore throat, cough, joint pain, chest pain, testicular pain, and parotid (salivary gland) pain.
               
Following a few days of recovery, a second phase of illness may occur. Symptoms may consist of meningitis (fever, headache, stiff neck, etc.), encephalitis (drowsiness, confusion, sensory disturbances, and/or motor abnormalities, such as paralysis), or meningoencephalitis (inflammation of both the brain and meninges). LCMV has also been known to cause acute hydrocephalus (increased fluid on the brain), which often requires surgical shunting to relieve increased intracranial pressure. In rare instances, infection results in myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord) and presents with symptoms such as muscle weakness, paralysis, or changes in body sensation. An association between LCMV infection and myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscles) has been suggested.
               
Previous observations show that most patients who develop aseptic meningitis or encephalitis due to LCMV survive. No chronic infection has been described in humans, and after the acute phase of illness, the virus is cleared from the body. However, as in all infections of the central nervous system, particularly encephalitis, temporary or permanent neurological damage is possible. Nerve deafness and arthritis have been reported.
               
Women who become infected with LCMV during pregnancy may pass the infection on to the fetus. Infections occurring during the first trimester may result in fetal death and pregnancy termination, while in the second and third trimesters, birth defects can develop. Infants infected In utero can have many serious and permanent birth defects, including vision problems, mental retardation, and hydrocephaly (water on the brain). Pregnant women may recall a flu-like illness during pregnancy, or may not recall any illness.
               
LCM is usually not fatal. In general, mortality is less than 1%.","Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM) is a rare viral infection that can cause a range of symptoms. The most common symptoms of LCM include:

1. Fever: A high fever is often the first symptom of LCM, and it can last for several days.
2. Headache: A severe headache is a common symptom of LCM, and it can be accompanied by sensitivity to light and noise.
3. Stiff neck: Many people with LCM experience stiffness in the neck, which can be accompanied by pain and limited range of motion.
4. Meningitis: LCM can cause inflammation of the lining around the brain and spinal cord, known as meningitis. This can lead to symptoms such as headache, fever, and stiff neck.
5. Seizures: In some cases, LCM can cause seizures, especially in people who are older or have a weakened immune system.
6. Confusion: LCM can cause confusion, disorientation, and difficulty concentrating.
7. Fatigue: People with LCM often experience fatigue, which can last for several weeks or even months after the initial infection.
8. Muscle weakness: Some people with LCM may experience muscle weakness, especially in the arms and legs.
9. Rash: In some cases, LCM can cause a rash, which can appear on the skin and be accompanied by itching and burning.
